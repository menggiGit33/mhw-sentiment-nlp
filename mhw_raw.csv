I thought I'd play World once again to get all the items, weapons, equipment - in other words, 100% it in preparation for Wilds. It turns out those were some intensely rose tinted glasses cause the combat in DD2 feels light-years ahead of World in terms of fluidity and fun. I suppose the first time I played and ""platinum""d MHW was in co-op, which the game is designed around and it makes everything exponentially faster and more fun, but playing it solo? Genuinely one of the most clunky, sluggish, frustrating and repetitive games you can get your hands on:

• Relatively recent but has unskippable cut-scenes and dialogue - that is in a game where the narrative is clearly an afterthought at its best. The Handler has to be one of the most annoying characters in gaming.

• Terrible co-op system that needs you to progress past the halfway point of missions to actually invite friends for said missions. Even From Software co-op is better than this.

• The combat, for Action-RPG enjoyers that have played the Souls games as well as Elden Ring, I will try to sum up how it feels in World:
-- You are a Dark Souls 2 character in terms of clunk and slow controls but somehow it is made even slower and clunkier, animations, stagger lock, even healing legit take 5-10+ seconds to recover from, barely any i-frames - all the while enemies you fight are like Fire Giants on crack that dash around constantly and half their attacks turn them into giant hitboxes.

• One of the worst, counter-intuitive control schemes I've ever experienced. You have to try it for yourself to fully understand the extent of how jumbled up and exhausting all the controls and UI feel. If you don't want to try it, well if you have seen those Ubisoft memes where people take stills from different games and ironically copy-paste 100s of UI elements on them to mimic/ mock Ubisoft, that's how MHW looks all the time unironically.

• Repetitive as hell, tickle a monster's taint for 5 minutes while occasionally getting stun-locked, boss decides it is time to run off to the other side of the map > spend minutes traversing the convoluted maps with slow as snails movement > boss is enraged now meaning the bullshit is dialed up to 11 > repeat until monster is dead.

• I have already mentioned it but everything is so damn slow... Stamina while running outside of combat in relatively huge and convoluted maps. Sheathing and unsheathing weapons takes ages and is a necessity to do constantly as characters refuse to sprint or pull other actions like heal with weapons unsheathed.

Think of how a 100-200h long game of exclusively that would be like, that's Monster Hunter: World in a nutshell. Fanboys of the series take on calling it ""slow and methodical"": in reality, it is just tolerated because:
1. Co-op, MHW is designed around it, that mechanic alleviates the majority of the issues this game has, especially combat issues as even +1 additional player + their calico can bring a ton of breathing room into the fight by pulling aggro,
and
2. People that have been conditioned through years and several MH titles to believe this is what good game design is like - truly the blue cheese of video gaming.

All in all, this is a game for co-op first and foremost, an incredibly bland, repetitive and frustrating boss rush experience for solo play.

Absolutely not recommended for solo play, don't get caught up in the hype and the positive reviews - you will have an awful time. However if you want to buy it for co-op, I do recommend it.",False,18041,18041,1737797811,1737797811,1,0

76561198044767950,186356275,"I got mixed feelings about this game,wish there was option depends between yes and no.
The most glaring issue is gameplay itself (I am in Iceborn dlc now)and grind that consitst it. It's  tedium to grind out basic stuff and with progress,that tedium becomes chore( i had doubts if i play game or do job,because my job is less tedious than this game).On bright side modders entered the scene and fixed that with their mods(probably that's why Capcom hate them),gameplay consist circle that even ape would learn,choose quest,eat food to boost yours stats and go hunt monster(kill or capture) and that's it. You gain some measly rewards(mods can fix that).

Plot well plot is same way as plot for porn movies(seriously), I don't quite remember whole story whatsever that how dull it is, but i remember Handler and her obnoxius pestering each time i log in.
Monster design starts nicely you got base monsters for each biome(and they design are very well done) and with progress appears variants of those monsters and here devs probably run out of ideas,because basically it's reskin and recolor of base one,big shame in my opinion.

Difficulty is greatly connected to how much you grind out stuff,so basically again if you work hard game may become trivial,if you are lazy then you will have high wall to jump trough

NPC design well they look like gene pool was restricted very much and the preetier bunch died out leaving the average and ugly with lots of interbreeding, handler for example,without mod looks like well someone kicked her once during childbirth and 2nd time when she grow up 

Sound and music are strongest points of this game, monster roars differs from intimidating to less intimidating depends wich monster we deal with, each biome got 3 sets of music,fighting with small/medium monster,big ones and chase,each fits so well adding to experience greatly

Graphics itself are nice aside some npcs(let's be honest like 90% of them)

76561198392578274,186305523,"My love for the Monster Hunter series is a long and storied one.  It all started with Monster Hunter 4 and Generations on my Nintendo 3DS – games that were so compelling, they were the sole reason I purchased the console.  The Switch followed, of course, driven by the allure of Rise.  And now, thanks to my Steam Deck, I've finally experienced the sprawling world of Monster Hunter World, and it's been nothing short of amazing.
 
From the start, I was captivated.  As a lifelong fan of dragons, the sheer variety and power of the Elder Dragons in World was a dream come true.  Facing these majestic beasts, utilizing the environment to my advantage, was a thrilling experience.  The core gameplay loop – hunting monsters, crafting powerful armor and weapons from their remains, and then using that enhanced power to hunt even greater beasts – is incredibly immersive.  The sense of progression is satisfying and deeply rewarding.
 
What truly sets World apart for me is its grounded, realistic approach to the monsters and their ecosystem.  The way the monsters interact with their environment, the subtle details of their behavior, and the ability to use the surroundings to my advantage in combat felt incredibly immersive and believable.  This realistic approach, combined with the stunning visuals, elevates the combat to a new level, even if the pace is slower than previous entries in the series.  The trade-off is well worth it for the visual spectacle and the visceral impact of each attack.
 
I primarily focused on the Longsword and Dual Blades, drawn to their elegant yet powerful movesets.  The satisfying shing of the Longsword and the lightning-fast strikes of the Dual Blades perfectly complemented my play style.  The cute Palicos, always ready with a timely attack or a humorous animation, added a touch of levity to the intense hunts.
 
While other Monster Hunter games have their own unique charms, World's more realistic and visually impressive approach to the monsters and their hunting grounds truly resonated with me. It's a testament to the series' enduring appeal – a game that consistently delivers thrilling hunts, rewarding gameplay, and a deep sense of accomplishment.  Playing it on my Steam Deck only enhanced the experience, offering the perfect blend of portability and immersive gameplay.  Monster Hunter World is, without a doubt, a highlight of my gaming journey.",True,5426,5426,1737736472,1737736472,5,0

And I am reinstalling it right now in order to try and tackle that challenge. Because its just too damn good. The game is huge, and Iceborne doubles its size, maybe even more than doubles it. The game is hard - you might need to go do some reading, watch some guides, practice your weapon of choice, and learn several - some hunts just aren't good with certain weapons. 

This is not The Witcher 3 - you will not be hunting monsters like that. This is Dark Souls bossfights and scavanging for consumable items. This is 20min fights being a short mission, with hunts usually taking close to an hour. This is about beating yourself, your best time, the amount of times you cart (die), hunting the same beast over and over till you are wearing its skin as armor and swing a sword made from its fangs.

I cannot in good faith recommend this game to people looking to get into MHW for the fist time, this will drive you nuts having to build around, I can barely build anything i want without having to farm monsters for a chance to get a part.

76561198088775807,186106979,"The only real complaint is some of the monster attack hitboxes being laughably bad, but that's very rare. Fatalis has a lot of them, but really the only other ones I can think of is whenever a monster dashes and it will catch you when you are behind them and not touching them at all. It's also possible to be CC locked or true combo'd but I don't really feel cheated when that happens since 90% of the time that comes from a miss-play or miss-position. I'd also say Alatreon is a really easy fight with an annoying gimmick, I do think the explosion circle is a cool move and so is the headbutt, since they both give opportunities to punish. However the arena walls and rest of the fight is not great. In contrast Fatalis actually feels like a real fight and challenge, even if he has some light siege elements. I wouldn't even bring it up if it wasn't one of the final bosses. Nothing is as bad as the FF14 crossover boss on extreme though, and I love ff14.

anyways I love this game, It's amazing. I understand how people can sink 3k hours into this alone and have been playing the franchise for decades. I like Worlds weighty, and less arcadey gameplay style more than something like Rise, but that's looking at Rise as a comparison, as a monhun game, when it's also a great game still.

Oh, also some stabs and explosions and slams from monsters have lingering hitboxes for some weird and unknown reason, which makes no sense and is very dumb. an explosion shouldn't linger and a stab also shouldn't linger and damage you. it's possible to roll with i-frames through these things and get hit anyways, like with sidesteps on a lance. Small thing since you can always get away from them, I just find it stupid. I think that covers every complaint I have. Which only affected like maybe 15% of my entire playtime and only 5% of it was actually a negative experience.

All that said, Alatreon is a horribly designed monster and they should never do anything like it ever again. I don't think we need to worry about that, I just wanted to state the obvious in case it wasn;t clear since I actually like some aspects of Alatreon.",True,17317,16487,1737489072,1737627997,0,0

If you are playing solo there is much to enjoy in this game. There are a lot of cut scenes/story and the fights are fun and the monsters are interesting.

We came for multiplayer from rise before wilds drops next month and oh boy are we disappointed. The fights are not playable together until you watch the cut scenes, of which there are many and are unskipable, and then you need to send out a distress signal mid monster fight just to get your team mate in the game with you. Yes you can hunt the monsters together after but i would rather just do it together and enjoy the experience together from the get go. I'm sure multiplayer is much more fun if you have completed the story but right now its been horrendous for us trying to get through the slog of animations just to finally be able to play together. I'm glad this wasn't our experience from rise and they clearly learnt from this game. Sadly this is why I'm thumbs downing it as what i came here for was a fun time with my friend and so far we haven't really had that but i must stress if you love solo play i would recommend this game!

76561199151519276,185957645,"Boy I sure love Monster Hunter World, since everyone says this one is the best of series after all. I expecially love:

-Love how there is lots of detail and realism, at the trade of everything looking washed out and hard to see, that the game needs to have little yellow paint scout flies letting you know what you can interact with, not to mention boring, all the weapons look generic and don't reflect the monsters that the weapon is made out of.
     -Love how the game is constantly reminding you of basic things, and said wisps are always telling you what to do and what to interact with and where the monster is, Your (ugly) helper never goes away and stops telling you the obvious either

-Love how the maps are huge and that hunts revolve around looking for tracks droped randomly that are mandatory to collect for the monster to even spawn in, and god forbid you need to unlock the monster first. And once you do finally get enough scooby doo clues, the fights are mostly it running away and you chasing it down over the length of a entire state, making hunts take way longer than needed (""but the throwabl-"" shut up)

-Love how the tutorial is nearly 2hrs long and somehow still manages to teach you barely anything of note (just like the only monster hunters, except those were 5 mins long, if they even had one)
Also the tutorial ends with a pop up letting you know theres micro transactions that you still havent bought, which always leaves such a good taste in my mouth, when the game I just bought is asking me for more money.

-Love the limited availability of certain quests for the sole purpose of artificially padding out the grind, keeping you in the hamster wheel since world tries to be a live service game with limited time events, quests and daily login bonuses. which thankfully none of which is still maintained.
""but you can just ignore that"" I can NOW cause Im playing this game years after support for it was dropped so all the predatory tricks to keep you playing dont work anymore and thankfully capcom released a update that lets you play and event quest at any time.
Wilds without a doubt will repeat all the same practices as world, doubly so since capcom has gotten more and more comfortable with bs micro transactions in their games, even their single player ones, which will guarantee I wont be picking it up until the next mainline monster hunter is annonced and all the annoying crap is removed from the game. 

-and how the game is now pretty much exclusively multiplayer, even though due to the abundance of cutscenes, if its the first time doing that quest, your friends have to wait until you watch the cutscene revealing the monster or whatever it might be, before they get to join, leading to a very start and stop multiplayer experience, so if your tagging along with a friend going throw his main quests, you get scroll on social media for a few minutes before joining. Oh and because its multiplayer only, no pause button, even if your playing alone, in the game with the longest most drawn out hunts in the series.

-Admittedly the monster turf war mechanic is pretty cool at first, after you see it half a dozen times though it becomes annoying and breaks up a hunt thats already pretty start and stop as is. This mechanic went on to become pretty cool in rise, letting you ride and control the monster to fight the other kaiju style, but in world, the clutch claw and turf wars, are janky and mondo pace breakers

So as you can see its clear why world is the best selling monster hunter to date, cause its just sooooooo good, cause popular means good after all, and if you dont see it that way its cause of skill issue and you dont get monster hunter, and dont like having fun",False,463,407,1737308269,1737313929,1,0
76561199188254846,185957286,"Despite its stunning graphics, beautiful monster designs, and impressive environments, Monster Hunter World left me frustrated for several reasons. As someone coming from Sekiro and Elden Ring, I found the game's approach to player onboarding excessive. The tutorial section drags on unnecessarily long, filled with slow-loading cutscenes and endless menu explanations.

The user experience also proved challenging. The HUD is cluttered with information and difficult to navigate. The combat, particularly in early encounters, feels repetitive and lacks the skill progression I expected. Even basic monster fights require an excessive number of hits, and without a visible health bar, there's no sense of progress during these lengthy encounters.

What particularly disappointed me was the game's heavy reliance on RNG mechanics for item drops and equipment forging, especially in a full-priced game. For $8, I expected a more streamlined progression system rather than being forced to grind repeatedly for materials. Free-to-play games like Genshin Impact offer more straightforward advancement systems.

While Monster Hunter World excels in visual presentation, the actual gameplay experience failed to capture my interest. The combination of tedious tutorials, unclear combat feedback, and RNG-dependent progression made it difficult for me to enjoy the game despite its beautiful aesthetic qualities.",False,129,129,1737307967,1737307967,3,0

What Didn’t Work for Me:

Time Spent in Menus: I spent about one-third of my time organizing inventory, crafting items/armor, reading notes, and upgrading equipment. Another third was spent mostly being lost while trying to “hunt,” and only the remaining third was actually fighting monsters. Ideally, I’d prefer a ratio more like 1/10 in menus, 3/10 exploring, and 6/10 in combat.

Co-op Experience: I really wanted to play this with my co-op partner, it seemed like the perfect game for us! But the experience was ultimately incredibly frustrating. The clunky mechanics for progressing through the story in co-op mode, often having to play through missions basically twice, eventually made us stop playing together. I’ve heard this improves significantly in Iceborne, but we didn’t make it that far. Also a small issue, but when monsters started whimpering and limping away, my wife felt sorry for them and didn’t want to hunt anymore. The game never made it clear why we were killing these creatures, so unless they looked like a T. rex trying to eat us, it started to feel like we were the villains somehow. Between the clunky coop and the limping we eventually stopped wanting to logon to progress.

Final Thoughts: On paper, this game seems perfectly designed for me, possibly even one of the greatest of all time. But the issues above got in the way of enjoying the game and we couldn’t slog through it to reach what seems like the “good stuff.” 

I DO recommend this game, but I think World's story should really should be played through as a single player experience first, maybe with some help occasionally from other players if needed on a hard monster.",True,3354,3354,1737226777,1737226777,0,0

World and Iceborne share the same rating. World decided that it would make decorations randomized. Decorations are the pieces that complete a build, of course. So if you happen to be unlucky and never get the good decorations no matter how much melding and farming you make, some fights are just straight up inconvenient to do. For most of the game, you are forced to play sub-optimally until you get lucky enough to get things like weakness exploit, expert, or critical boost decorations that really give a build the oomph it needs to win a fight. That, or you do have those decorations, but you don't have the utility skills like razor sharp or protective polish because you never got the decos for them. 

Then there are the RNG rewards. Fuck the RNG rewards. If I carve a tail, I want to get a tail. I should not randomly get some dumbass scale or some other thing that can be found elsewhere on the monster. For some monsters, tails are hard to cut or break especially if you didn't get the partbreaker deco in the RNG decoration grind.

The Scoutflies are retarded. Sometimes I have to disable and enable a waypoint just because they stopped working or sent me the long way around a destination. The weapons are a disaster. They're just slap-on monster parts on templates. The armors are a mixed bag, ranging from nice to butt ugly.

As for the fight against the monsters themselves, the game relies on difficulty via amazing ranges or wide area of effects. Of course, the game suffers from skill parring. You need at least 1 evade extender decoration to make the dodge feel decent in distance. Lord knows how many evade window decos it takes to make the dodge feel good in i-frames because I still don't have them, no matter how many of those dumb jagras event quests I do. When you finally beat Shara Ishvalda, you feel less elated and more glad that it's over, but it's not over. Of course this title has an endgame that doesn't know how to end, filled to the brim with boss fights that even at the game's best, the hunter is forever ill-equipped for. 

I've played MHFU and the transition to MHW made all the good changes except for where it mattered most. The game is still plagued with low drop rate rng bullshit, plagued with a lifeless village with people pretending that they've been working with you when all they've done is bark orders and make you do the heavy lifting. World pretends it has a good story around a settlement working together to survive, but the npcs can't be bothered to fire cannons themselves and they still make you pull the dragonator lever when someone else could have literally done that. 

There are lots of tidbits about monster ecology that could have been good to leverage in gameplay, but they just windup as set-dressing. It makes the game ""look"" alive, but feel dead. At the end of the day, the ecology knowledge has no bearing on your ability to hunt monsters. It matters little that Barroth eats ants, or that Pukei-Pukei eats shrooms. These are never leveraged enough in gameplay that there's so much wasted opportunity for actual interesting quests.

World is a large step-up from MHFU, but it's easy to make a large step away from a disaster. So far, Monster Hunter Rise/Sunbreak is the only game that has successfully distanced itself from the tedium of the old. If you want a truly modern MH, skip this, and buy Rise/Sunbreak. Rise is a bit bland, but the Sunbreak expansion is a vast improvement from World/Iceborne. I suggest skip this game or wait for MH Wilds, though I'm certain that MH Wilds will take a lot of cues from World for the worse.",False,15345,11500,1737068078,1737068078,0,1

I'm done, I get why ppl can like the game, but the more I play, the less I actually enjoy the game. It feels like work instead of a game and as monsters get harder it feels less and less as if I'm actually fighting the monster and more that I'm fighting the clunky controls. As I said I can understand why ppl like it and if you're willing to work and probably suffer for it, you likely can get a wonderful experience, but this is worse than Dark Souls to learn. In Dark Souls your character reacts when you push a button, in this game in fights I had a 60% chance that my character would react when I pushed a button because of various stuff from waiting until your character finished an uninterruptable animation to having a monster chain roar while not having the perk equipped to not get stunned from roars.

The gameplay? What can I say? It's monster hunter. You hunt monsters and then you collect parts from the monsters you hunt to make better or different gear to hunt other monsters. That is the game in a nutshell. You have a non-combative partner named the Handler who is in charge of eating everything on the table and a cat that makes cute noises and can assist you in combat. There are elf women and midgets and dangerous cacti and a lot of dragons. My favorite monster is the Kirin. Also, you have a lot of weapons to choose from and I still have not really tried all of them fairly. Progression in this game does feel very fast and the campaigns are very very long. There's also way more things after the campaign and they used to have time limited events and stuff.

honestly I love this game. I love the idea of progressing through the monsters, grinding for gear so you can take on tougher monsters and so on. I am right now at the end of the base game and I am having a blast. For anyone considering playing this game and reading this, here are a few thoughts of mine. The game feels awesome, being able to choose from so many different weapons and play styles is awesome and everyone finds their preference. Of course the game can be difficult at times. The wall monsters can give you hard time, but usually if you take the time and learn the moves you will be able to overcome them. The fighting system and the controls are awesome and the monsters really do feel alive. I cant sing enough praises for this game.

76561199004938000,185631337,"TL;DR: If you like gameplay-focused games, grinding, and beating large monsters with cool weapons, you’ll love this game.

I love this game. This is one of the best gameplay-focused games I’ve ever played. I always prioritize fun gameplay over story or graphics in a game, and if you’re like me, you should give this game a try.

In my opinion, the story and graphics are just okay (I don’t really care about them, but I thought it was worth mentioning). I saw the story more as a tutorial for the main game. You’ll learn the basics of hunting and using weapons through the story missions, and the game truly opens up after you finish the story.

You can also play co-op for most of the story quests. I say “most” because, in some instances, you’ll need to finish the first phase of a monster fight before you can call for support.

The game isn’t perfect, though. I’ve experienced random server disconnections and occasional crashes. And if you’re an achievement hunter, you’ll need to pray to RNGesus because many achievements are tied to RNG. If you have patience and plenty of time, you’ll be fine.

There are 14 weapons in the game, so you’ll definitely find one that suits your playstyle. I main the Switch Axe (aka Swaxe) and absolutely love it. But I’m also trying to learn the Bow, as it will help me with the basics when I play Monster Hunter Wilds.

Oh, and by the way, when buying the game, make sure to get the Master Edition so you’ll have access to the DLC. If you didn’t know, when the DLC was released, some mechanics were rebalanced, and they actually nerfed the base game. So, if you don’t have the DLC, you might notice these changes.

In conclusion, Monster Hunter: World is an amazing game with insane gameplay. From the intense battles against massive monsters to the wide variety of weapons and playstyles, it’s a game that keeps you coming back for more. And I love the community.

More into the gathering, preparations, tracking, then hunting/capturing the monster, yea it's all about process.

World is my favorite, in terms of gameplay, but combat is quite fast and yeah they actually give some extra in the slow-mo scene where you land your final hit after mounting monster. it's pretty tough using clutch claw because i played rise first. I love meowscular chef

Plays and looks great, that's for sure. However, I still think this game was made to be used with a controller a bit more than k/m controls. It's fine, but it doesn't seem as fluid as the console version tbh. Maybe I'm just more used to it due to my time on that console playing the game. 

Anyway, game looks amazing on PC. Plays amazing on PC and has unlocked framerates with DLSS and just runs awesome. I've forgotten a LOT since I last touched the game and it's fun re-learning everything from scratch again. Good times. Also, I will say the sound is a LOT better if you have your PC hooked up to any kind of 5.1 or 7.1 system or cans. Sound is actually done really good for the PC version. Seems to be a lot better than running the 5.1 or 7.1 for the console. Could be a console limitation as well. Meh. 

I will say this though. Try to get the Monster Hunter World Complete Edition if ever possible. Possibly on sale. That will include the main game, Iceborne and all the smaller DLCs that they want to nickel and dime you to death with. DLC is actually pretty ridiculous but to each their own. It's all cosmetic anyway.

76561199204533738,185551932,"One of the better Monster Hunter games from a gameplay, presentation, and graphical perspective.  As an old school MH fan, there are some changes that I think the series needed that maybe didn't click with me for a while.  The maps are dense and incredibly deep to explore, but sometimes make for cramped, lame places to fight the monsters (mainly looking at the Ancient Forest and the one bone swamp map, as other maps are VERY fun to fight monsters on).  Some of the weapon changes are improvements, though they turned my longsword from a combo king to a counter king, which makes it much less fun of a weapon for me.  Weapon designs leave a lot to be desired in the base game, and monster designs are pretty good, but I think not quite as strong as other MH games.  Despite my longsword complaint, this game has near peak combat mechanics in all of video games.

Multiplayer is very flawed in this game though, and is a major downgrade from most MH games dating back to the Wii era.  A Wii game had better multiplayer than this??  Crazy, but just the truth.  Playing with friends can often be a major chore - it is not as simple as 'join your friend's lobby and do quests together'.  There are awful shenanigans with cutscenes, which force players to play solo, even when in a multiplayer lobby, if they want to both progress the game.  It's quite honestly a hot mess. 

All in all, a great entry in the series particularly if playing solo, and imo a necessary step that has some growing pains out of old school MH, but is held back by poor weapon design and highly disappointing multiplayer lobbying.  Even so, this is a solid recommendation from me for MH fans, action game fans, and fans of cool monster designs.  I found that despite the bad multiplayer, it was STILL worth playing with friends just because monster hunter at its core is that great.  I personally prefer Generations, MH4U, and Rise to World, but that could be nostalgia...",True,2718,2709,1736823789,1736823789,0,0

76561198050229973,185488364,"I do not recommend this game specifically for coop because they force story quests to be played on single player until all cutscenes have been encountered, and story-based expeditions can only be played solo. The only parts of the game you can reliably play entirely with others are optional side quests. It makes playing through the main game on coop really frustrating, since you have to leave and re-join quests at unknown points because you never know what's going to trigger a cutscene. It completely kills momentum having to ""sync up"" with other coop players for what seems like an artificial limitation. The worst part is the game doesn't communicate these limitations well, for example it explicitly prompts for a party size when beginning a story quest but then forces the party size to be 1 any way, without any feedback as to why, I had to search online to figure out why that was happening.

Another major issue I have is the keyboard and mouse controls. They feel really ""off"" (especially menu navigation) and the keys used for unrelated functions change depending on whether your loadout is melee or ranged. I had to switch to a gamepad because the keyboard and mouse controls were too awkward, it was clearly designed for console inputs first and foremost.

The game is self-explanatory, you hunt “animals” essentially but that would upset PETA, so Capcom calls them monsters instead. You will start off picking herbs and mushrooms for medicinal purposes and lesser monsters which all combinates into you hunter the animal kingdoms version of God because its head makes for a good hammer and its skin is used to make a new outfit. Afterall fashion is king. 
The gameplay loop is a loot treadmill where you go on hunts to gather materials to then use to make new weapons and armour and maintain the eco system or something. If you find yourself struggling with a monster return to our ancestral roots by picking up your favourite meat mallet and go full unga bunga on the beast and if that doesn’t work fire and SOS flare and hope an Asian dude drops down to solo the monster in under 5 mins for you.

76561198036652431,185245359,"Hoo boy, this is a review that's gonna take some thought.  Alright, we'll see how this goes:

[b]TLDR:[/b] My overall thoughts on Monster Hunter are positive. It is absolutely a fantastic game. However, there are some serious caveats that I think need to be addressed.  If you're willing to work around those caveats, you'll find this game to be 100% worth the money, and then some (especially if you get and its expansion on sale).


[h2]Pros:[/h2]
- Dense, beautifully crafted hub worlds and levels filled with loot, secrets, and environmental hazards that can both help and/or hurt you when fighting.  (one of my concerns with the upcoming Monster Hunter Wilds game is that the large open worlds that they've created - at least when I played the beta - felt emptier than the levels in this game)
- The story (while relatively simple), really nails down the feeling of adventure and exploring someplace new.  Spoiler: You're a member of an expedition team mapping out new regions and investigating the wildlife while protecting human interests and avoiding the ruination of the expedition team. This was one of the games where I followed a lot of the cutscenes because the whole story was just..fun.
- The creatures and NPC behavior in the various environments is incredible. All the awesome interactions between creatures and the environment makes things feel like a realistic ecosystem that the creatures inhabit.  Monsters have territories that they fight over. They prey on smaller creatures. They have routines that can be used against them. It's great.
- The combat (once you get used to it), is incredibly engaging, making fights against tough monsters feel intense and weighty.
- The sheer variety of gear and cosmetics would make a fashion designer salivate.
- The game is enjoyable in singleplayer, but there's just something so great about the multiplayer SOS system. Some people argue that multiplayer ruins the difficulty of the game, but I disagree. It's so cool to be able to call for help and have people drop into your session, showing off all their cool gear and tactics while taking on a threat. The same goes for you showing up to help out others. The community is (mostly) pretty supportive and you'll see max level players helping out newbies in quests all the time.
- My experience with the expansion (which has mixed reviews, mostly related to changes in how combat works with a tool called the Clutch Claw), was almost completely positive - but I can understand where people are coming from when they say they don't like it. The amount of content it adds however pretty much stacks a whole new game on top of an already stacked older game, giving tons of hours of new environments, monsters, and more.


[h2]Cons:[/h2]
First off - this game is a grind.  I've heard people call the game an ""MMO-lite"" which makes sense. I've done two playthroughs of the game with different weapons. The first playthrough took me ~40 hours, and made it through the base game to the end of the story, with a small amount of followup on the post-game content.  During that playthrough, I never really understood how people could continue playing after the main story was beaten.  Sure, there was loads of endgame content, but a lot of it felt like fluff tacked on to give people something to do.  

The second playthrough (which took ~200 hours over the course of a few months) happened under unique circumstances.  The current job that I work at gives me a massive amount of independence, and I often have a lot of free time. I also have a friend with unique circumstances that allowed us to play through the game together pretty frequently, and I think that benefitted the 2nd playthrough immensely. Together, we went through the whole main story, and then later bought the expansion during a sale and played through almost all of that before burnout finally hit the both of us and we moved on to new games.  We were able to really dive deep into the various RPG systems and buildcrafting because we could afford to sink time into it. For us, it was a fantastic game that we sunk time into because we had the ability to, but not everyone has that luxury. 

Second, the UI menu systems, combat control schemes, and various crafting and upgrading systems can be very daunting. There are things that I wish the game had changed with regards to its control schemes and menus to simplify navigation. Sure, I got used to it - but not everyone can deal with it. Once again, it will take time to understand and learn how to navigate.

Thankfully, there are mods that can fix some of the various issues that people have with the game. I highly encourage checking them out if you find the game to be too overwhelming, or not quite what you want from it. If I'd had some of the mods for my first playthrough, I probably would have played longer.  But second time's the charm!


If you're able to get over the hurdles and learning curve required to understand and play the game, you'll find an incredibly fun, immersive action-RPG with a fantastic world and loads of content to explore.  There's a reason why this game is still popular many years after its initial release (if I recall correctly, it's still in the Steam Top 100 games being played today!).

The gameplay loop is very simple: (1) you prepare for a hunt (2) you hunt monsters, (3) then, you use the materials from the monsters you hunt to get better gear to hunt stronger monsters. Rinse and repeat. Everything outside of the hunt has it's own fun, but the meat and bones of the game lies in it. Mastering your weapon, learning how each monster attacks, knowing what equipment and items to bring - these all make the game so interesting and so fun.

My only quibble with the game was how daunting the multiplayer aspect of this is - at least, when going through the story. You had to watch the cutscenes separately, then everyone except for the host has to leave the hunt and rejoin it. It was very annoying to do that for every single time we tackled a hunt for the first time. Nonetheless, this is only a problem during the main story and I believe there's no issues at all anywhere else.

There's plenty of intricacies and different skill levels available for most weapons, and any weapon in competent hands can clear every challenge the game has to offer, though it never stops feeling challenging.
The games pacing is fantastic, and is balanced well for every new tier, and of course at certain times throughout the game you'll hit roadblocks with certain enemies, and the answer is to delve into the deeper mechanics of your chosen weapon and learn to take every advantage the game offers you, which means everything from equipment, traps and environmental features.

The combat feels really clunky with a really noticeable input delay and the controls themselves just feel strange with some odd button mapping. There's plenty of varied weapons and items to loot but essentially this game is just a boss fight simulator with huge demands for endurance rather than skill. Some of the bosses are really well-designed and the fights start off fun but can then become exhausting especially when they last so long.

Good game, but just that. This game will become ""perfect game"" if content isnt separated from DLC like mastery weapon or claw slinger, you know what? the gap, the gap between MHW only content with MHWI content is just too massive, dps, defenses, mechanic, etc. You will understand when playing multyplayer, also they combined player with DLC n original, so it just make me disappointed and also it's the reason for me to stop with MHW (ill not buy the DLC). I know the game developer need to make profit, but reducing content in main game just a worst decition. Only 6 days that i took to complete these game, now without DLC i can't continue.

MY REVIEW
STORY : 7,5/10 Good story but only take good and not further, also story or main quest is just too fast in my opinion, typical we will forget the story as long we play or grinds
GRAPHIC : 9/10 Great on high graphs 240 fps, good effect, good character's expression, perfect art style with as Monster Hunter game
AUDIO : 7/10 Standards
GAMEPLAY : 8/10 Just like other typical ""Monster Hunter"" 
MECHANIC : 8/10 Good, just need experience

""OVERALL MONSTER HUNTER SCORE IN MY OPINION IS 7.5 (tbh ill rate it around 6 if im not Monster Hunter fans)""
 Im not sure to recommendate this game, but if youre chill person or not rushing to finish the game then you will like it. but if youre looking for long play terms without DLC, ill not not recomend it. ALSO after reading some reviews and youtube videos about DLC ICEBORNE my decition is ""NO"". Thats all my opinion about this game, thanks for the experience.

Suggestion for Capcom or Developing Team, you should NEVER reducing mechanical content and putting in DLC. in my opinion DLC content should only for further game in-game equipment like brand new monster and maps, underline this ""reducing content or separating content is criminal"".",False,4977,3625,1736382242,1736382242,0,0

76561198822987469,185083991,I am by no means the best at this game however as someone coming from Rise I thought that this game at first was super fun. I enjoyed relearning how to fight in combat with the use of the slinger and having to actually dodge instead of using wirebug spam to make my way through each fight. During Low and High rank was not a single issue. Yeah the slinger wasn't exactly designed for the base game but it was still extremely cool. Master rank at first was the same with nothing really being different. The same old grind set of fighting monsters and then making armor to then go fight other monsters just like monster hunter should be. Then the difficultly spiked to playing a dark souls for no logical reason. I did not sign up to play this game in order to attempt a dark souls boss. I signed up to hunt funny monsters and have a fun time with friends. Alatreon however spikes the difficulty out of no where with no warning. If the game before this point had a more gradual increase in difficulty this wouldn't be such an issue however that is not the case. For Alatreon you have to memorize every single one of his moves to have a chance at beating him. It also doesn't help that when you try to do the running dodge in game to avoid the damage instead the game just preforms a roll dodge instead and you die. On top of this his mechanic of elemental damage threshold having to be met if not you get instantly killed is only cool on paper but is horrible to play against. It also doesn't help even if you do meet that threshold then you have to have enough speed eating to still live through it. This fight's difficulty only exists to extend gameplay hours and there is nothing before it to help prepare the player for the difficulty spike. If this monster makes a return in Monster Hunter Wilds I would much rather just go fight Amutsu with only Kunai then have to fight this monster again.,False,5888,5852,1736320098,1736320098,3,3

76561198383384236,185050597,"This is, at least to me, probably the worst game in the franchise. Enemies can combo the user to basically guarantee fainting, healing and cleansing take several seconds during which you can be attacked again to exacerbate the problem presented by excessive application of damage-over-time effects, monsters can kill you outright within a couple hits, monsters can knock you down and you have to stupidly mash the W key to have the common sense to stand up, and monsters can STUN YOU which leaves you standing but you again still have to stupidly mash the W key to have the common sense to not just stand there like a target dummy. The mechanics of battle are just simply completely ridiculous, to the point that it isn't even fun.

If I'd had a demo of this game, I wouldn't have bought it. Even with the ""special event armour,"" it just doesn't compensate for the atrocious battle mechanics that are so stupid they render it entirely impossible to enjoy. I've played other Monster Hunter games, such as Tri, and loved them. It was about skill and learning tricks & techniques to overcome impressive monsters, who didn't have excessively high HP with you spending 30 minutes fighting them with more than half of it spent either dodging or reloading/resharpening your weapon because you would ordinarily have enough ammunition to kill any one large monster if you were using the ranged weapons and it was rare to have to resharpen your weapon once, much less 10-20 times in one large monster fight - during which you can still be attacked and it will throw you through the air without even the courtesy of autofinishing the resharpening because your ever-so-adorable Palico can't happen to keep the thing's attention for 3 seconds while you resharp your weapon for the 23rd time.

It's honestly like they conspired to make the game as unenjoyable as possible, stacking up as many annoying and ridiculous mechanics and shortcomings as possible to ensure very few people would actually have the stamina (which, at least, doesn't run out in 2 seconds like it does in Far Cry Primal's Survivor mode) to get to the later game where you MIGHT get gear that's actually worth having. I'd almost say I'd be more effective in these fights running around WITHOUT armour on, but there doesn't seem to be a difference in how quickly you die with or without armour - or how agile you are with big bulky heavy metal armour or excessively fluffy armour, or skimpy leather.

As an aesthetic observation, the armour's also bloody ugly and the layered option for 'aesthetic armour application' .. is just the super ugly armour in another equally unflattering colour, which means that while you've got a good number of options for designing how your character looks ... it won't matter because they'll be buried under armour that's not only hideous, but functionally useless, anyway.",False,1959,1842,1736284010,1736284010,1,0

It's heavy to extreme levels of grindy (2 other friends helped split the workload to mostly acceptable levels) and its not an intuitive game system. With little to no tutorials its a very 'muck about and find out' approach to figure out the learning curve and/or your preferred weapon type. If you're willing to make heavy use of a wiki/walkthough, but that always feels like cheating, doesn't it? I thought we had beat the game but in retrospect, we got the the halfway mark in the story and said good enough. 

Steam DB says this goes on sale for 13$ regularly, i think it is absolutely worth that price if you have the free time to sink into it. i liked the idea of this game, the crafting-progression system is a game mechanic that on paper really tickles my pickle, but the late game grind was ultimately is why i only played halfway through. in practice, the reason we used the wiki so much is the information is added to your game only after you kill the monsters multiple times. if you've killed them that much, you probably don't need the tricks/tips, so while it makes sense, it sucks that it provides you help after you no longer need it.",True,2689,2689,1736281539,1736281539,0,0

[i]Dear Diary,
After hundreds of hours on PS4 and now another 20 on PC, I can confidently say that experiencing this masterpiece twice was worth every second. From console to PC, the hunt never gets old.[/i]
[h1]The Cross-Platform Chronicles[/h1]
[b]Phase 1: The PS4 Veteran[/b]
Spent countless hours mastering every weapon, learning every monster pattern, and building the perfect builds on PS4. The original release consumed my life - every hunt, every investigation, every crown hunt etched into my muscle memory. The Sapphire Star's light guided me through countless nights of ""just one more hunt.""
[b]Phase 2: The PC Renaissance[/b]
20 hours into the PC version, and it's like falling in love all over again. Smoother framerates, faster loading times, and crystal-clear textures make every hunt feel fresh. Even after all those PS4 hours, watching Nergigante dive bomb in glorious PC graphics never gets old.
[b]Phase 3: The Double Dip Joy[/b]
Starting fresh on PC might seem crazy after mastering everything on PS4, but there's something magical about experiencing it all again. Every weapon feels new, every monster encounter exciting, and this time, I know exactly which builds to aim for.
[h1]The Hunter's Log[/h1]
PS4 Hours: Countless
PC Hours: 20 and climbing
Platforms mastered: 2
Monsters re-hunted: Gladly
Loading screens avoided: Thanks, PC!
Regrets about buying twice: Zero
[h1]The Verdict[/h1]
Was it worth buying twice? [b]Without question[/b]. Does it hold up on both platforms? [b]Absolutely[/b]. It's like watching your favorite movie in IMAX after loving it on TV - same core experience, new level of appreciation.
[i]Now, if you'll excuse me, I need to go recreate my perfect mixed sets on PC. These monsters aren't going to hunt themselves, and those improved graphics are calling my name.[/i]
[b]P.S.[/b] - To my PS4 character: You served me well, but your PC cousin is about to experience everything in glorious 60+ FPS.

76561198168369779,184933413,"For the TL;DR crowd...

If you've never played MH before, this is an okay place to start. Especially if your friends are also playing it. I would suggest Rise more tho.

If you're coming here from Rise, or (late from) 3U/4U, I would suggest you temper your expectations a bit before making a purchase.

For those who want something more in depth...

I played this game when it came out on PS4. I was excited, though I had my concerns as it seemed a little soon to release. Playing through it even back then, I found it cosy at best but also... a little boring. In fact, there's a lot of factors I can see now that hampered my enjoyment of this game compared to previous entries that I'd played. I'm going to be comparing this game a lot to past entries for the purpose of highlighting why I think World was an overall downgrade. I will throw Rise in there for comparison also to highlight other details.

For one, the new features are... underwhelming. Sure, the game has had a graphical upgrade, it's filled to the brim with clutter and maximalism that wasn't possible on the 3DS. But the gameplay mechanics comparatively are not exciting from a gameplay perspective. Most of World's changes are quality of life. 

Potions are now crafted on the fly, you don't need blue mushrooms to make em, no stock of pickaxes and bug nets, cinematic travel bits, monsters can smash parts of the environment to new effects (this isn't especially new), the game is overall easier and so on.

Compare these changes with Monster Hunter 3 Ultimate with it's underwater combat. Iffy in execution, but unique. Alongside the introduction of the Switch Axe. The difficulty was toned down for its own reasons, but it had good qualities.

4 Ultimate added verticallity to the land and coupled that with difficult to perform and continue; mounting monsters. As well as adding two new weapons, the Insect Glaive and the Charge Blade. Not to mention 4 Ultimate had one of if not the biggest number of monsters of mainline Monster Hunter. Even if you dial back to 4 Vanilla, only few are not a part of that roster. And this isn't even factoring in the number of weapons, frenzy virus mechanics, visual effects caused by Gore Magala when enraged and so on. 

4U did so much. And while I understand that World can't fully be blamed for having less, I can't help but think this was all intentional withdrawal. It's clear they wanted to attract a new audience, though I doubt they expected nearly the amount of traffic they got. Reducing the amount in the game makes it seem fresher to a new audience and can make it easier to raise the stakes for whatever game that comes next. I've seen it a million times over.

Conspiracy theories aside, World is genuinely disappointing. Because not only is the roster of monsters lower, with generally the same core gameplay, but the game hides even more of its roster behind paid DLC. Why is this a bad thing? Because Monster Hunter 4 Ultimate had a smorgasbord of DLC, collabs, mechanics and stuff that was all free. None of it was paid. This was true of Generations Ultimate too. What's more, you could download it and do it anytime. There was no restrictions that forced you to allot it within a certain time frame like World does. Thankfully Rise revised this issue.

I will also say, and I know MANY will disagree with me on this... The overall QoL improvements, in my opinion, hurt Monster Hunter's gameplay identity. There was a reason you couldn't move while using a potion before, it was a risk and you had to learn the timing of it. There was a reason you had stiff, decisive attacks you couldn't easily back out of, once again, risk and decisive gameplay. While I'm grateful for the removal of hot and cool drinks. Bug Nets and Pickaxes, as well as items you bring on the quest in limited stock forced you to think. Having a safety net of items removes the disappointment of forgetting them, but it fits with the whole vibe of ""being prepared for the hunt"" which cannot be overlooked. 

In ways I think streamlining this was good for accessibility, but harmful for the core gameplay from an expression perspective. Now you may suggest... ""Well. Just pretend you have limited use for the bug nets"" or ""Don't move with a potion."" And those would work... if it actually kept the vibe alive. I don't feel like I have to prepare for bug nets, because there is no preparation, and the game is built around the player moving with a potion. I can't really play the classic way and get away with it. Besides, I find the logic of having to gimp yourself inhibits the experience of... Y'know, being a hunter, jumping into the bowels of danger.

Upon revisiting the game, I learned once again how bad the Ancient Forest is, especially as a first map in the game. The added layers, the overusage of clutter which obscures items which if it bothers me, imagine how that is for the visually impaired. Other maps in the game are... generally fine, I have no major issue with the others. Ironically while I find the Rotten Vale the least visually interesting to look at due to mindless clutter, the spaces actually feel spacious, which is nice.

Once again the added mechanics and tuning of them are underwhelming and lend themselves to easing the experience up a lot. The emergence of world and its usage like poisonous plants to create puddles to affect foes, tricking em into a dam that can unleash water knocking em down... Those are really cool! But I feel they take partially away from the zen feeling of hunting a monster. 

The one on one, learning patterns, mastering them. It's still there, but with so many options to give you the upper hand, I find it undermines that approach to mastery. Slinger Ammo is another. Easy ailments, easy stun, easy damage. I can spitball a monster and suddenly the danger is lessened. Mantles are similar, another tool to ease the gameplay up. Stealth mechanics are neat, but very easy to exploit for easy heals. Lost is the feeling of fighting an opponent technically greater than you, and here is the feeling of using outside sources to reduce the monster's chances of doing much to you at all. Mounting clearly wasn't enough.

The major issue I have is I don't feel like my own repertoire of moves or skills has increased, I feel like my number of scapegoats in tense situations to remove that tension all together has increased. Rise at least introduces the wirebugs to allow you to act immediately in the heat of the moment, some applying more risk-reward for skilled players to achieve mastery with wirebug skills.

I recognise this is quite negative, and World is far from the worst game I've played. There are aspects I like! Some of the new monsters are neat enough. Tobi Kadachi is unique with its active motions, Nergigante deserves its popularity as a genuinely fun and hard monster to fight, Zorah Magdoros is a cool name. The story may be lacking, but it's Monster Hunter, the characters could be more enjoyable but it was certainly not their focus here. 

If you ask me, it's no wonder why a lot of Japan dropped this game for Rise. World is... cumbersome. The hub world is a pain to traverse compared to the small compact ones of other games. The visuals are cluttered and uninteresting despite the upgrade. The newer mechanics serve to dampen the experience rather than enhance it. It's certainly not all bad, but I can't help but look at World as a fundamental soft reboot for the franchise to draw in new unsuspecting meat. Think about it. The mechanics for easiness, limited roster. the spaced out approach to gameplay, the lack of cool and wacky weapon designs past games had. World to me was either unfinished or to throw crap at the wall and see what they could get away with. 

You may enjoy World a lot, don't let me take that from you, more power to you! But I only hope you can understand why I find this one lacking. To me, it's just okay at best.",False,912,912,1736174389,1736174389,2,0

 -If you are debating if you should get into the Monster Hunter Worlds at this time. Yes you should.

- MHW has very addicting and rewarding play loop. You Hunt, Scavenge Repeat. The grind itself is rewarding as you progress you get better and more bad ass looking gear.

-Each new monster is a new challenge as they are all very unique and have different attacks.

-It has a bit of a learning curve but not hard to get into. You can play with various weapons that each has a unique play style and armors can provide different advantages to different monsters. These can later be customized more in depth to suit your liking and help with not only scavenging but with hunting monsters themselves.

That being said, gameplay will keep you engaged as you will want to keep climbing the ranks and hunt even larger monsters.

The Biggest con is Co-op. It is a pain to connect when you first start out seeing as one of you has to have seen the stupid unskippable cutscenes, How I wish there was a better mod for that, Skippable cutscenes  is not cutting it. 

Rise did better with this and traversing the map with the dogs and wire bugs, but rise lacks the polish of world and the combat in world feels better.  I really wish I could mash the two games into one

unfortunately if you DO want to get a game to pay with a friend quickly, rise is going to play better for now, do this game solo till you beat it THEN play multiplayer, Or get a good chunk ahead of your buddy.

76561199655422566,184840419,"An incredible game! I highly recommend it for gamers in general, whether you like action games, RPG games, or whether you're a single-player gamer or enjoy online co-op.

The gameplay loop is very satisfying, You go on quests, hunt monsters and do other tasks, earn Zenny, upgrade weapons and armor. You can also choose different playstyles that you might prefer (different weapons and whatnot). I really enjoy the combat gameplay as well, I found melee combat to be very fun and well-designed. I also really like the exploration aspect of it, I like roaming around the environment a lot and that's another satisfying aspect for me.

The graphics are very detailed, with breathtaking environments in particular. Graphics aren't everything, but this game does the graphics aspect very well.

Monster Hunter: World is accessible for both hardcore gamers and casual gamers, and is designed for gamers new to playing Monster Hunter without being at the expense of the core Monster Hunter players and fans. That is what I appreciate: Capcom gave it wide appeal in a successful manner by attracting both Monster Hunter players and the gamers new to Monster Hunter.

The game is also enjoyable for both single-player gamers and online cooperative multiplayer. I especially like how unlike some games, online multiplayer is completely optional. That's part of the reason I avoid playing live-service online multiplayer/MMO games (sorry not sorry Helldivers 2 fans). Fortunately, Monster Hunter World is both a single-player game and online co-op game and that's what I really appreciate about it.

My rating: 5/5
One of my favorite modern video games, and sets an example for the modern AAA video game industry (among other great games). Great gameplay alone and having both single-player and local multiplayer options makes it very much worth it.

Even with the more recent Monster Hunter Wilds, I still highly recommend Monster Hunter: World as an incredible game to play.

You’ll find yourself tracking down incredible beasts, many of them breathtakingly beautiful, only to fight them in battles that feel as heartbreaking as they are thrilling. When they limp away, wounded and crying, it hits you right in the feels. The story? Simple yet haunting: 'We don’t understand them, so let’s kill or capture them.'

And yet, I love every second of it. With its unexpectedly deep mechanics and stunning world, this game earns a solid 10/10 from me.

I played with controller.

Game has a lot of seasonal content, so even when single player, there's different things to collect year round. 

Complaint wise, the game is too short. They should have just kept doing expansions, I'd have bought them, It's fun and the content provided is great. Looks like the devs would rather make sequels than expansions, which is too bad.

There is a lot to learn with this game, but it is all beneficial to your time spent in game and once things click with you everything feels so good. I beat the base game around Thanksgiving and snagged Iceborne for $10 on black friday. I had got the base game for $10 the previous year as well. I would have gladly paid more looking back at how much fun I have had and how much I still have to do. It is safe to say I am invested in the Monster Hunter series now.

76561199388135263,184313314,"Monster hunter is one the franchises i started playing early in my childhood and I hold monster hunter close to my heart and have fond memories across multiple games and this game just adds more to them memories. These games were there to lift up my mood when i felt down or had a stressful day. 

I have also met and bonded with a lot of people via monster hunter some of them even becoming friends outside of the game. Like any game there is a few stinkers in the community but the majority are friendly and are willing to help newer players reach the heights of master rank. Monster hunter world makes this easier as the multiplayer is encouraged more with the inclusion of the siege monster and SOS flares.

Monster hunter world takes world building to a new high as i genuinely felt like i was in a locale with all the vibrant wildlife in the background, it also does a good job at making most of the monster fit into their habitat with their abilities making biological sense such as Pukei Pukei eating certain nuts to enhance one of its attacks or Zinogre coexisting with thunder bugs to give it the power of thunder.

i recommend this game as there is something for everyone whether it be hunting for the best fashion, speedrunning, achievement hunting, chilling out with friends, making friends or simply just to kill spare time it has it all. You'll never get bored as there is also new content to discover, i was 500 hours in a only discovered that you can trade with felyne tribes when you get there bond to max.

Coming from years of competitive gaming, I didn’t know what to expect when I picked up Monster Hunter World. The RE Engine feel´s alive with its visual fidelity.  The detail in monster animations made hunting feel immersive; you can see their exhaustion, their fury, and even their desperation as the fight drags on.

The hunting system is the core of the experience, and it’s brilliantly crafted. Each hunt feels like a puzzle, requiring not just skill but preparation. Studying monster behavior, crafting the right tools, and choosing when to engage or retreat made every encounter thrilling.

As a first-time player, the game was daunting at first, but the onboarding process was well-paced. The game respects your intelligence, giving you the tools to succeed but leaving much to discover on your own.

If you’re like me, someone looking to branch out from the competitive gaming scene, this is an incredible place to start.",True,24810,22167,1735617185,1735617242,12,0

76561198039884422,184042953,"Monster Hunter: World is one of my favorites in the series. If you are on the fence about buying it and playing before Wilds, I would definitely recommend that you do. Below are some points of feedback for the developers from a long-time fan: 

With this entry, Capcom went all in on graphical fidelity and simulated ecology. I very much appreciate that the New World feels alive, with many animals all living in the same ecosystem and displaying what makes Monster Hunter special: it treats mythical creatures as if they were normal animals and explores their biology and behaviors. With the increased graphical fidelity, Capcom was able to present these ecological details in game, rather than through FMV cutscenes like what Monster Hunter Tri had.  World is easily the most immersive Monster Hunter game when it comes to being in the field and observing the environment.

However, World makes some changes that I view as negative for the series. Much of what you do as a hunter has been changed to lessen that feeling of ""mythical creature hunting simulator"" that earlier games in the series had. Much of the crafting system has been removed and made obsolete, especially with the inclusion of Iceborne. I never had to worry about my supplies in World for multiple reasons, the first being that there are very few monsters in this game that require you to bring specific items to the hunt to beat them. Secondly, the game hands you hundreds of the items you need by playing a slot machine in Seliana, so you never need to think about making more of an item. In prior games, it was always fun (admittedly type 2 fun) to go out into the world, find herbs/mushrooms/insects, and bring them back to the farm so that they could be reproduced. You would then build up this farm over the course of the game so that you could help supply the items you need for hunts. This farm still exists but the fact that there is no separate area where you can see those plants growing has always been a little strange. It also yields a ton of supplies, so you can essentially stop interfacing with this system after only a few hunts, rather than throughout the game. The supply management part of the game has essentially disappeared, which was a large part of selling the hunter simulation. 

I view the inclusion of the Clutch Claw as largely negative. The Claw is by no means required until you begin attempting Alatreon and Fatalis, however, it will significantly decrease hunt times throughout the whole game. Combining the Claw with the Temporal and Rocksteady Mantles, along with the mounting system introduced in the 4th generation games, leads to monsters spending a majority of the hunts flailing on the floor. I personally think Monster Hunter games are at their best when the hunter is just barely dodging attacks and counter-attacking even while the monster is still in an attack animation, all while using items they have prepared to their advantage. When monsters spend most of the hunt on the ground, it disincentives the player from learning the monster's move set when they can simply kick them while they are down. The Clutch Claw regularly feels like the best option for disabling the monster and has left every other option in the dust. This also means that fights were balanced around constant use of the Clutch Claw. Monster Hunter Wilds looks to have at least toned down the Clutch Claw, which I think is a good decision. 

I love the endgame of Iceborne. Safi'jiva, MR Kulve Taroth, Alatreon and Fatalis are excellent fights. Alatreon and Fatalis feel so tightly tuned that the ""just barely dodge the monster's attacks and counter-attacking even while the monster is still in an attack animation"" style of play is required. Overcoming these fights feels like a monumental achievement, especially doing them solo. I hope that Wilds has similar fights that require a ton of preparation and knowledge, as well as the ability to perform well for an extended period of time. These fights are peak Monster Hunter endgame. 

The Guiding Lands was not peak Monster Hunter endgame. The quest system of Monster Hunter feels great within the context of the world because they are contracts put out by the denizens who live there to solve problems they have, hence why you receive reward money for doing them. The Guiding Lands is instead a landmass contrived to allow you to grind monsters endlessly for materials required to upgrade your gear even further. It feels like a gameplay contrivance to make people play the game longer rather than something that works in the context of the setting. Further, endless upgrades beyond creating the best weapons does not feel good and I think the Augment system should be left behind with World, as someone who had several fully augmented sets. 

This review may have sounded mostly negative, however, I wanted to make the issues I have with this game the bulk of the content. This game is pretty close to perfect for me and those things mentioned in the review are the pieces of feedback I want to give Capcom, what I want them to change and build upon.",True,16666,16666,1735429919,1735429919,0,0

They all play very differently, and I don't have the time or patience to memorize every monster's attacks and behavior in an effort to just ""get gud.""

The boss fights are too long at higher levels. The timer can run out on monsters you discover in the wild when you're playing solo and you might lose out on a monster you have 3/4 of the way defeated. That stinks!

But the core gameplay of facing down monsters, crafting better gear, and then being able to discover new monsters is really rewarding for a while. It does get repetitive, it does get samey. Especially when your moveset with your favorite weapon doesn't really expand as you progress. The monsters always seem to level up just as much as your weapons and armor does, so it never feels like you have a leg up on your opponents. 

So for me, the discovery was what made me enjoy my romp through the base game. I've taken a break once unlocking Iceborne, and plan to return in a year or two to discover more monsters and see what this ""end game"" loop is all about.

It can be frustrating. It can be unfriendly to newcomers. But there is helpful community and there is reward for spending the time to ""get better"" at Monster Hunter: World.",True,3135,3135,1735096609,1735096609,0,0

76561199142988598,183570947,"Have you ever wanted to chase down a dragon the size of a skyscraper, only to realize halfway through that you forgot to pack enough healing potions? Welcome to Monster Hunter: World, where the monsters are huge, the stakes are high, and your cat sidekick is somehow a better cook than you’ll ever be.

This game is a masterpiece of chaos and strategy. You’ll spend hours meticulously crafting the perfect gear to slay a fire-breathing wyvern, only to trip over a rock and get tail-slapped into oblivion. But don’t worry—your Palico will revive you with the power of snacks and moral support.

The environment is breathtaking. From lush jungles to desolate wastelands, the game is a visual feast. But don’t get too distracted by the scenery, because a giant T-Rex with anger management issues is probably charging at you from behind.

And let’s talk about the multiplayer: nothing bonds you with friends like screaming “IT’S BEHIND YOU!” while dodging a monster that’s somehow learned parkour. Just make sure your squad knows how to aim their slinger, or you’ll all be airborne for the wrong reasons.

Monster Hunter: World doesn’t just let you play; it throws you into an ecosystem where you’re not the top predator—you’re lunch. And it’s glorious. The grind is real, the rewards are sweet, and every hunt feels like an epic showdown.

I recommend playing solo first before 8 stars as 4 man/ group hunts make early hunts waaaaay too easy and you wont learn how to properly play against monsters as The Defender Series makes earlier hunts a walk in the park tbh so i recommend not using it for those who want to slowly grind the game. Also, do optional quests and try to clear any other quests given as you can get stuff like mantles from said quests that can help a lot (an example would be the Bandit Mantle that will help you farm gold really easily).
Dont forget to get stuff from the argosy in port as you will have an abundance of pts to spend.
I recommend getting the DLC too just for the clutch claw. Although some dont like said mechanic for making hunts way easier.

World is a perfect evolution of the Monster Hunter formula, bringing modern quality of life changes and systems to the franchise. I bought it on PS4 back when it came out, played the hell out of it, bought it on PC and played the hell out of it again, and even now I still get the itch and roll up a new hunter every once in a while. The Wilds trailer was the latest cause of the Monster Hunter itch, and as much as I enjoyed Rise, World just scratches that itch in a much more satisfying way. If you haven't played Monster Hunter before, World is a perfect jumping in point. The tutorials are informative and detailed to get even the freshest newbie acclimated to hunting in no time.

76561198062942863,183065976,"This is possibly one of the best monster hunter games. They took everything from the last generation and made everything far better.
Use the environment to defeat monsters, a bunch of different tools along with new ones that are better, a good list of weapons with new combos. And little things like how you can actually move around when using an item to restore statuses or give buffs. Along with there being more item drops from monsters for buff items, instead of just one monster having that one item to make better buff items. However the early game weapons look a bit boring, which isn't the strongest thing about this game. Another thing that was tougher with the old games, was getting points and money. The other games would barely give you any points to use for getting items, while here everything is more forgiving along with giving you a better skill to receive more items. You'll still have to actively get points in the game, but its far less tedious compared to previous Monster hunter games (hint: Elders recess is good for points)
Besides all of that, the game still looks great for something made in 2018, and even back then the entry level for this game wasn't that high, looking great on PS4 (but not Xbox One lol rip)
Pretty much most entry level laptop and desktop GPUs can run the game at medium, like whats listed in the specs. And if you have an entry level Nvidia 30 or 40 series card, it will look even better.
I should also mention this game takes some getting used to, but the difficulty curve isn't that high compared to other games. Some advice would be learning a monsters moves and predicting them, which is the case for any more difficult game. But in the end this is a really fun game, with the atmosphere and beauty of the game making it feel more than just a combat focused game.

On top of that, the game is surprisingly beginner friendly, as far as Monster Hunter goes. The mechanics are all very conducive, while still retaining the tight and precise movement and gameplay that some of the older titles tend to have, without trivialising the experience either (er, besides the defender gear being available so early...

The armor in the game is astounding visually. you wont find too many other games with this level of armor design. the game can be a grind for certain equipment but is well worth it and it doesnt feel super repetitive fighting the same monsters. this game is for sure a good start to a fantastic franchise and i cant wait for wilds.

76561198381094758,182956505,"Alright, I told myself I wouldn't post a review on this game until I had achieved a thousand hours on it, call it a personal milestone of sorts, I couldn't even tell you why exactly I set this condition upon myself. But regardless, I got to this point, and I think this game was due for a review.

To get this out of the way, yes, I absolutely recommend this game. To try to keep my reasoning for it however, would be impossible to do in a short manner, so while I don't blame you for skipping the rest of this very long review, I leave this for anyone that may be weird enough to care to listen to some random guy on the internet rant about what is probably one of their favorite games of all time, if not their favorite as of writing this review.

If you're still reading, then here it goes. Keep in mind I'm not used to writing reviews like these, so I may ramble on way too much.

The first ever time I hear of Monster Hunter was back in 2023, a friend of mine was streaming themselves playing it on a discord server, they spent most of their time in Astera (which for those that haven't played it yet is basically just the basic hub area). And spent some time in the training room to showcase me and some other friends the different weapons of the game.
I thought the weapons looked cool, although nothing that really ""wowed"" me, the aspect of a sword that transformed into an axe, or a giant katana, were definitely interesting, but it takes a lot more to get my interest in regards to videogames.
I decided to give this game a go during that year to see if it was worth my time, picked up the Sword and Shield as it was the ""beginner"" weapon. 
I hated it.
I'm not bad when it comes to 3rd person action games, but this game I just couldn't *click* with. At the time the weapons and combat felt clunky, things like stun and elemental blights felt like complete and utter bullshit, nothing about the world interested me in any way, things like finding the monster felt tedious, and so, I left the game around the first Zorah Magdaros quest, and I never picked it up again until next year.

Going back to the friend I mentioned, that friend group is no longer. I no longer have contact with anyone but the aforementioned friend that was streaming the game to me.

It may sound corny, and while I certainly don't want to trauma dump to a random reader, this devastated me.
For me, these people were my family, and I would've done anything for them, even if they were across different countries, the experiences and the love I had for these people is something that I don't think I'll ever achieve a similar kind of bond to the one I had with these people, one of them in particular, the one I was the most fond of, hates me and wants nothing to do with me.

I'm not going to bore you with the details of what went down, but this, among other issues that I've been dealing with since my high school years, made me spiral down and hit rock bottom in a way I never had before.

I've been dealing with depression and abandonment issues for the longest time, and it wouldn't be an exaggeration to say that event left me quite literally heartbroken. This was around back in May of 2024.
In a discord server with the one remaining friend I had from that group, amongst several other people, they were watching on stream one of the new trailers for the new game, Wilds. Everyone in that group (including myself nowadays) is a *huge* Monster Hunter nerd, and while they were screaming and hyping up everything on screen, I simply did not understand what the craze was all about.

But because I didn't have anything better to do with my time, and I was desperate for a distraction from the issues I was dealing with, I decided to give World another try. A new save file, to start from scratch, really give it a proper chance, this happened in June.

Fast forward to December and, well, I think my playtime speaks for itself.

Few videogame worlds and universes have captivated me as much as this one has. I learned to love everything about the game, things that annoyed me such as tracking down the monster back then were now one of my favorite aspects, and something I missed in the next installment of the series. I loved the monster designs and how unique and varied they were, I loved how unique every weapon was, each one having their own completely separate playstyle and moveset as well as mechanics.
I used the Sword and Shield again, and to this day that weapon, despite having tried all the other ones, is still my main.
The combat felt so weighty and deliberate, I found myself really planning out my attacks based on my position and what the monster was doing.
And then I finished it.
And then came the expansion.
And the expansion? Oh, brother, the expansion. It feels disingenous to call it an expansion, it felt like a completely new game, a direct sequel of sorts.
It heightened everything I loved about the game and more, even monsters that I didn't like at first I have grown to appreciate after several hunts. (This does not apply to Rajang, however. Fuck Rajang. I hope that stupid ass ape never comes back in Wilds.)

About the middle point of base game I came to learn about Fatalis, the very final monster in the expansion and the entire game overall, a monster that has multiple appearances across the series, revered as the biggest challenge, specially in this iteration of it, one that many people have simply given up on defeating, purely because of how insane the challenge is.
And I told myself ""I'm going to beat it. I'm going to beat it completely on my own, while using Sword and Shield.""

Obviously I was getting ahead of myself, this I knew. But it's funny. Before I started playing I was genuinely contemplating suicide, and the only reason I hadn't yet was because I didn't want to hurt anyone by leaving, but even then I doubted that anyone would truly care, and even if they did, they would simply move on.

Yet as I was playing, I couldn't even think about that. I was too busy to focus on that. When I was at work all I could think about was getting home to keep playing this videogame. I would lose hours of sleep because I needed just *one more hunt*. I would waste so much of my free time because I needed *a stupid fucking Legiana gem oh my fucking god bro*.

The idea was that, if I pulled that off, then maybe I can do whatever I set my mind to. If I could do what a lot of people give up on, then maybe, just maybe, I was good enough to pull off anything I wanted.

And I wasted hours, and hours, I lost almost an entire week of my life just going at it. And there were times where I felt like quitting, but I couldn't, if I can't even defeat a fictional dragon in a videogame then what can I really do? I told myself that this is something I've done a million times. Attack patterns, openings, I've done this all before. I *knew* that I could win. That I would eventually win.

And I did it.
And seeing that camera pan away, as the black dragon went limp and its lifeless body lied on top of the cold ground of Castle Schrade. I screamed like I never had before, not out of anger, but out of happiness, of pure ecstacy and pride.

I still see myself coming back to this game, even after I finished Rise + Sunbreak's endgame. I still come back every now and then for a hunt or two. And all I could say after I defeated Fatalis and came back to Astera was ""What a journey, man.""
I genuinely don't know where I would be, had I not given this game a second chance. And I'm glad I did.

If you're still reading, I'm thankful that you gave me the time of your day to read some guy ramble about his favorite videogame.
And I'm thankful to everyone who worked on the creation on it.

The combat is great although you kinda need Iceborn DLC to make it lot more fun, the base game combat kinda dated (no hate for the OG fan) and the monster cast kinda lacking. From what i've experienced from other game alike, Monster Hunter by far has a lot more emphasis on slower combat, it has less forgiving i-frame and a slower attack animation for some weapons (understandably, cuz can u imagine a greatsword having the same fast animation like dual-blades). Also the graphic and the tiny detail of the world really holds up for a 6 years old game.

A master class of wasting your fucking time and acting like it's all ""immersive"" and ""vidya gamey"" when in reality you've just wasted 30-50 minutes fighting a monster only to die in an instant, lose your max HP and then get punished for trying to continue your progress. My breaking point to spark this review was the master rank rolly polly looking ass mother fucker in the final area of the base game, where he  never staggers when I need him to and he never stops rolling and  blowing shit up - one shotting my cucked health bar out of nowhere in 0.5 mili-shits. The constant falling over, staggering, paralisis, being stunned by monster roars, stunned by monsters shitting on you - it has taken over 100 hours to finally break me. At this games worst it plays slower than Dark Souls 2, and at best you're having fun for 15 minutes until the monster your fighting goes into a rage state which never ends and has no break, spamming the same god awful moves with the same god awful hit-boxes the series in essentially known for. 

Oh yeah, and If all this wasn't enough, the games story, which is A-typical anime garbage crap with no meaning or substance (can't even be fucking bothered to name their characters). It insists that you DONT SKIP ANY CUTSCENES, where games like Cyberpunk let you skip anything and actually have subject matter worth fucking talking about. The idea of killing monsters isn't that fucking complex, and if you want me to care about your 1-dimentional garbage characters maybe give them some fucking names you idiot HACKS. 

For the last 3 days I've played this game I've done nothing but say its shit, the devs are shit, and every monster which has ever given me a hard time is shit. This game isn't without redeeming qualities, it's fun to learn a fight and then dominate it but I've never been this pissed off with any of the Dark Souls games more than this shit. There's too much bullshit to call it fun for more than an hour. Every minute your being slowed to the pace of molasses, and fighting MR monsters which take 20-30 minutes to fucking die, sometimes more if they cuck you with a super funny combo or one shot from down town. Waste of fucking time stupid moron garbage made by idiots - I've never wanted to go back in time and beat myself more than for playing this game.

Fuck this. Right now, this game isn't for me. If this obviously rage fueled review scares you away, GOOD. 
FUCK THIS GAME, AND FUCK MONSTER HUNTER in it's entirety.

Can't wait for Rise tho, looks pretty cool.

76561198996950205,182774085,"Monster hunter is a game that I feel needs little introduction, but perhaps that’s less of a testament to how well the game communicates and more of an overt expression to how impossibly addicting the fantasy of monster hunting is. It is a game for the people, about ambition and the might of the little ones who dare to hone their skills under the spectre of impossible odds, every limit can be broken, every monster can be hunted, and everyone can understand the feeling of overcoming such walls. But beyond the idealistic takes on human ambition and it’s healing nature, Monster Hunter as a franchise is so very honest with itself, so unapologetically funny and absurd in all the correct ways to create a world that you desperately want to integrate yourself into. And I love that. I love that the arrows are the size of umbrellas, that the cats cook meals and walk on two legs, that the people living in this world still find time to drink and sing in-between hunts. 

Is it perfect? Of course not. Some mechanics are poorly implemented and grinding is not something they have succeeded in making enjoyable for the average hunter. I can’t say that I fully enjoyed every aspect of my progression through the game. I so desperately wish they could have implemented layered armour earlier in the game.

But I’m still here, despite it all.

The intricate landscapes and how monsters interact with their environments create a truly immersive world that blew me away when the game launched. Multiplayer is thrilling, though the requirement to sit through unskippable cutscenes before others can join story quests was frustrating. Despite this, Monster Hunter World remains an exceptional game that I highly recommend to action RPG fans looking for both a challenge and an unforgettable adventure.

[h1] Gameplay Depth and Challenge [/h1]

The heart of MHW lies in its masterful combat system. With 14 unique weapon types, every encounter with a monster feels like a dance of strategy and execution. From the first Great Jagras hunt to the grueling battles with Fatalis, each monster presents a unique challenge that demands mastery of timing, positioning, and weapon mechanics.

The satisfaction of defeating a monster lies not only in its difficulty but in how the game encourages adaptability. A fire-breathing Anjanath might require water-elemental weapons and fire-resistant armor, while Nergigante demands quick reflexes and heavy-hitting combos to break its spiked defenses. Each fight feels rewarding because it tests the player's ability to learn and adapt.

The addition of Iceborne elevated this experience. New monsters like Velkhana and Shara Ishvalda brought mechanics that tested even veteran hunters, while returning fan-favorites like Zinogre added nostalgic flair with modern improvements. The layered difficulty of Master Rank monsters ensures that even 2000 hours in, the game never feels stale.

[h1]Community and Co-op Fun[/h1]

One of MHW's strongest aspects is its multiplayer functionality. Tackling monsters in a team of four hunters transforms the experience into a chaotic symphony of traps, bombs, flinches, and coordinated attacks. Some of my most unforgettable moments come from multiplayer hunts, like narrowly saving a teammate from Rajang’s one-hit KO attack or perfectly chaining stuns with a team to lock down a monster.

At the same time, the game also rewards solo players. Solo hunts sharpen your skills and offer a deeply personal sense of achievement. The flexible difficulty scaling in Iceborne ensures that every hunt feels balanced, whether you're taking on Alatreon alone or with a team.

[h1]Endgame and Replayability[/h1]

For a 2000-hour player, the endgame is where MHW truly shines. The Guiding Lands, with its customizable biomes and region-specific monsters, provides an endless loop of exploration, farming, and challenge. Iceborne’s updates added new layered armor, event quests, and rotating festival content to keep the grind fresh.

The grind for perfect decorations and augmentations for weapons is a satisfying rabbit hole for optimization enthusiasts. Meanwhile, limited-time hunts like Safi’jiiva sieges and Kulve Taroth ensure that there’s always something to look forward to.

[/h1]Room for Improvement[/h1]

While MHW and Iceborne are near-perfect games, there are a few areas that could be improved:

-Palico AI is dog water

-Monster AI can get stuck and behave in weird erratic ways

-Multiplayer lobby was always trash. Needed to be streamlined in some way. Thankfully on PC there is a MOD FOR THIS.

[h1]Final Thoughts[/h1]

After 2000 hours, Monster Hunter World and Iceborne remain a benchmark for what action-RPGs can achieve. The thrill of hunting monsters, the camaraderie of multiplayer, and the endless drive to perfect my builds make it one of the most fulfilling gaming experiences I’ve ever had. Tackling the challenges of the game isn’t just fun—it’s addicting, a constant loop of learning, adapting, and overcoming.

Whether you’re a newcomer or a veteran, there’s always something to love in MHW. For me, every hunt is a story, every monster a mountain to climb, and every victory a memory I’ll treasure. I can't wait to see everyone in WILDS and look forward to hitting endgame with a great community of players.",True,294,293,1734000056,1734000404,0,0

76561198143171248,182524302,"Monster Hunter: World sorta passed me by in its hay day, and I'm still not sure why that is, because I'm now seriously regretting that I didn't get into it earlier on. 

Having come to World after really liking my experience with the Open Beta test for Wilds, I've really enjoyed my time with hunting monsters (all except for our lord and saviour, Dodogama) and getting to grips with all fourteen weapons, despite the fact that I'm several years behind the tide. 

I will say, though, that my experiences with the online community that still roams about, or (just like me) are getting into the series/game for the first time, has been supremely positive. The whole multiplayer shtick is incredibly fun, and when Wilds comes out, I'm sure to do some hunting alongside my friends. As a soulslike enjoyer who has always preferred the solo experience, I'm actually the opposite with MH - it feels much more rewarding personally to coordinate against monsters. Solo is still fantastic, but I like dabbling in both and feeling positive either or.

I'll list out some quick thoughts of mine:

The balance of the 14 weapons is great. None feel *too* strong or otherwise unwieldy. Tbh, at some points I would switch weapon every hunt, wanting to change up my playstyle (RIP my materials), and I essentially couldn't pick my favourite. I like every weapon. Now, in late Iceborne, I've calmed down a bit and narrowed my selection (for the sanity of the grind) down to Swaxe / Insect Glaive / Longsword. I can't wait to get back to Wilds now understanding the identity of the weapons (not me not knowing why my charge blade was bouncing off on Rei Dau or how to charge shield or use phials).

The content is massive, and while a lot of time can be spent rehunting the same monsters, the experience is still positive. It's rewarding prepping and learning the fights to optimise times and be almost hitless, something I'm somewhat used to from souls, but nonetheless in a fresh, different way.

There's a significant difficulty curve here and the game, at large, definitely requires a not small degree of patience (Iceborne mostly). I like this, but sometimes it can feel unforgiving - which is part of the challenge and the satisfaction of overcoming it, but when it's down to hitboxes or strange, seemingly untelegraphed attacks, there is an element of frustration. This does little though to ruin the game imo however. There's always ways to implement contingency plans, whether that's items, running away, using traps, guarding if you don't know what's happening, starting turf wars, manipulating the environment, (or just pogoing the glaive which is my go-to when there's fuckery about)

At heart, it's a game (and series more abstractly) that's about defeating that which is on a different scale than you, both size-wise and power-wise, so it makes sense that you can't breeze through it, and, in order to succeed, you need to deeply understand the mechanics and how weapons operate (if not reach nigh-mastery with them).

Overall, my time with MHW has been incredibly positive, and I really recommend the game (although, maybe it's best to hold out for Wilds at this point). All I have left to do is defeat the final, final monster and I'll likely leave this game happily in peace. Unfortunately, while I might want to reach MR 999, I have other things in my life.

76561198030017229,182466522,"It's finally time to write a Monster Hunter review. Monster Hunter is a series that can have a pretty high barrier to entry thanks to the myriad items, weapons and monster quests, all with usually little to no explanation.  I originally got into the series with Monster Hunter Tri on Nintendo Wii.  But it didn't really click for me until World.  This is in large part to Capcom making the game much more beginner accessible in World.  Between Playstation and PC, I have around 350 hours currently played.  Monster Hunter keeps me coming back thanks to the engaging combat, fascinating monsters, and freedom to try any and all ""builds"" you could want.  If you start playing hammer and get bored, try out a different weapon.  Play one weapon for 20 or 30 hours, then try something else, and keep trying all 14 weapons until you find your favorite.  Or if you're like me, just bounce around from one weapon to the next as your little heart desires.  If you've never tried a Monster Hunter game before, this is the best place to start.  If you find the item system overwhelming, just trust me and give it time.  Watch some really helpful guides on YouTube, and eventually, when the game finally ""clicks"" you will be hooked for life.  Happy Hunting.  

Overall, I give this game a 9.5 out of 10.  It's probably the best Monster Hunter game ever, and is just down right an amazing game.  It has it's quirks, but it's with the time investment.",True,8208,7941,1733885845,1733885845,0,0

Monster Hunter: World is my first entry into MH games, and one I fell absolutely in love with. The wild nature, the realistic monster-animals, the weapons you use to slay them to create that perfect piece - all of it gives me unending fun and joy whenever the game is launched, It's easy to get into, and requires little to no adjusting in graphical settings on a decent modern PC. The story in my eyes can be a little boring and simple, but no one expects to read a masterpiece when you're busy having the time of your life slashing, bashing and dashing.",True,11108,11108,1733796396,1733796396,0,0

The variety of monsters to hunt is diverse enough. Some monsters are impressive visually, some are really fun to fight. The weapons variety is also really good ! I mainly played dual blades but switching from time to time gave a different experience and different approach of fights ! 
Great amount of builds: armors and weapons all have some unique style ! I went for the things that looked cool to me instead of what is ""the best"" ! 
I actually really enjoyed the story, it's not much but it was enjoyable ! Iceborne brings so much more to this game and gives a great end to the story.

I originally played this on PS4 back in high school and I have so many spectacular memories attached to this game. I have nothing but praise for MH:World, from music, to graphics, to design. It's clear the devs put so much love and care into the entirety of this game. The environments are gorgeous and it's incredible watching the monsters interact with each other. From throwing hands with each other, eating, drinking... I could go on and on but the game feels so alive. I have spent hundreds of hours across three different platforms just exploring the ancient forest alone, headphones on, and listening to the sounds of the rain and the endemic life.

For all my praise, however, one must recognize that this game, or even as far as the entire franchise, isn't for everyone. There's a serious grind to get the materials you need and it's been there since the conception of the franchise. I joke with my friends about it being ""60% hunting and 40% tax paperwork.""

The only difference from The Elder Scrolls V is that you don’t load mods; instead, the playtime changes significantly thanks to expansions. However, even without purchasing the expansions, your playtime is still long, but the only difference is that buying the Iceborn expansion greatly increases your playtime. Other than that, the base game offers a solid amount of playtime; you improve yourself by defeating huge monsters and collecting loot, or you sell it to buy items in the store. You can play the game with friends or solo, and even though it's quite challenging to defeat bosses, it’s still enjoyable. However, teaming up with friends allows you to defeat bosses much faster. I really enjoyed the game and I recommend it; I thought I wouldn’t have fun, but my friend convinced me otherwise, and it turned out to be a very entertaining game.

TR : Bu oyun oldukça kapsamlı ve The Elder Scrolls V'e benzer bir oynanış süresi sunuyor. The Elder Scrolls V'den tek farkı mod yüklememeniz; bunun yerine, genişlemeler sayesinde oynanış süresi önemli ölçüde değişiyor. Ancak, genişlemeleri satın almadan bile oynanış süreniz hala uzun, ancak tek fark, Iceborn genişlemesini satın aldığınızda oynanış süreniz önemli ölçüde artıyor. Bunun dışında, temel oyun sağlam bir oynanış süresi sunuyor; devasa canavarları yenerek ve ganimet toplayarak kendinizi geliştiriyorsunuz veya bunları satıp mağazadan ürün satın alıyorsunuz. Oyunu arkadaşlarınızla veya tek başınıza oynayabilirsiniz ve boss'ları yenmek oldukça zor olsa da yine de keyifli. Ancak, arkadaşlarınızla takım olmak boss'ları çok daha hızlı yenmenizi sağlıyor.

76561198068617514,182082608,"Compared to other monster hunter games I played. This feels just bad. It feels extremely slow in the sense that your quest progression gets HALTED having to do extremely lame investigations that means you walk around, collecting random stuff slowly and then having to reload into the area to get even more. Then FINALLY get to a hunt and then after that, more lame slowness. Investigations wouldn't be so lame if you had a palamute like from Rise or some equivalent. Some of the quests are extremely boring (everything surrounding the like 15 minute Zorah Magdaros fights where you literally just wait around). The hub area is dumb. Everything is separated so you have to walk about 30 seconds or go through a small cinematic to go to an area if you don't want to walk to it. This is pretty much after every mission if you want to eat or go to the smithy. No reason for the hub area to be so spread out.

Questing with friends is also EXTREMELY stupid. I cannot quest with my friend because they haven't watched a cutscene yet in the mission? So they have to load into the quest, go and FIND the monster, watch the cutscene, then you can start the process of joining.  That is IF you have done the quest already. If you are BOTH trying to quest at the same time (as in complete quests at the same time), you need to LOAD INTO THE QUEST SEPARATELY, watch the cutscenes, then ONE of you has to back out to go join your friends ongoing quest..... Why tf can I not just join my friends quest and we can watch cutscenes together??? Can't even skip cutscenes btw without a mod. Rise doesn't have this problem nor any of the other monster hunter games I have played multiplayer with.

The game looks great, the combat feels good, the monsters are sick. Its just everything else surrounding the core of the game is so lame and rips you out of the feeling you get during a sick fight. Most of these gripes are from a progression standpoint, but the point of monster hunter is to progress and get sick gear for fights, not walk around and sniff footprints, watch lame shit, or some other lame shit.",False,829,829,1733523663,1733523663,3,0

Really fun game with you hunting dragons and dinosaurs with your trusted cat who also can fight. 10/10.

Summary: 
So I finally caved and got this game on sale with recommendation from friends, and let me say, I am glad I did!  So far this game has been extremely fun, despite having multiple challenges with the battles themselves. The Monsters (who I have dubbed Dinosaurs) are all unique, with each posing a different challenge (like the stupid Egg-Stealing Bird who WONT LET ME CATCH IT) and different requirements for each task you are given. There is very little glitches or bugs, and I am truly enjoying the journey so far! You can get a companion, a palico, who will quickly become your best buddy and will fight alongside you or provide health during fights. Mine is named Jack-Jack and he is my SON. There is armor customization and you can dress up your cat buddy with cute AF armor too, not to mention you can customize your character almost like you can in the Sims! 

Pros:
-Both online and offline play
-JACK-JACK MY BELOVED
-Customization
-Multiple weapon types and enemies
-Strategy
-Enemy AI

Cons:
-Older game, made in 2018!
-Online and offline play
-THE STUPID BIRD THAT WONT GET INTO MY CAPTURE NET

you spend half the game running as the monster is almost ""always"" enraged, and the other half wallbaning them. every ounce of skill required in the base game is completely thrown out the window for turbo optimized builds and knowledge checks. you dont ever get to ""fight"" the monster.

they actually just took everything bad about the base game, turned it  up to the max, then added half-assed mechanics that made it even worse.

roaring, moves spamming, undodgable aoe attacks, areas that require consumables to traverse, lack of build diversity. everythig is  just done and made worse.

I finally came back to World in late August of this year and decided to give the game another chance. It was definitely overwhelming to learn at first but, after trial and error the game became incredibly fun and enjoyable. This game truly has something for everyone. Whether you want to play it solo, or to mess around with friends. As well as different builds using different weapon and armor compositions to better improve gameplay. And for those overachievers out there, there are plenty of hidden achievements that you can unlock by exploring the locales that have no lack in detail. I highly recommend this game to anyone who is looking for an open world RPG to play.

Monster Hunter es ese juego donde te enfrentas a criaturas gigantes con armas variadas... y tu paciencia. Empiezas persiguiendo un dinosaurio con una espada de cartón y terminas corriendo tras dragones como si fuera tu trabajo de medio tiempo.

El verdadero héroe es tu camarada, un gato chef que siempre está ahí para salvarte o robar cámara. Cada cacería es un caos organizado: esquivas, gritas, y te preguntas por qué no llevaste más pociones. ¿Frustrante? A veces. ¿Adictivo? Siempre.

En resumen, es un festival de golpes, risas y ""solo una misión más"" que nunca termina. Y eso es lo que lo hace GOD.

Everything has a satisfying weight to it, from huge monsters crashing through boulders, to landing the final strike in your weapon's combo. The effects in this game make every action feel extremely rewarding. Features such as natural traps and monsters having different behaviours and encounters, like turf wars, without the player's input add to the living world of Monster Hunter. The  monster designs, music, and theme of the game are all perfect, and it is extremely immersive while remaining convenient for the player. The game is challenging and while sometimes frustrating, there are always methods to overcome a tough monster if you look hard enough.

Good progression, you never feel TOO outclassed for the hunt ahead.
Variety in weapons is fantastic, there is a playstyle for everyone here. 
Gameplay loop is solid and fulfilling. Hunt monsters, use parts for better gear. Hunt harder monsters, use parts for even better gear. Rinse, repeat. 
Variety in quest objectives keeps the tedium away. Everything from ""pick flowers"" to ""Kidnap Local Game Wardens"" to ""Kill God"" is mixed in there. 
The combat is top notch. You will learn spacing and tempo pretty quick or you wont progress, at least if you're playing solo. 

Only gripe really is some of the hitboxes on Monster's attacks seem too big, and others you'll be thinking ""How'd that not hit me?"". Gets a little inconsistent considering the wide range of Size variation on the monsters but thats just me nitpicking. You're a human with medieval weapons fighting Dinosaurs, so I get it.

First off, cutscenes and credit scenes are unskippable, which gets annoying really quickly. On top of that, NPCs in cutscenes walk at an agonizingly slow pace—and for some reason, your character moves just as slowly. It’s a test of patience.

Another issue is with the Palico (your cat companion). Instead of feeling like a loyal partner, it often seems way too attached to the handler, leaving little room for meaningful interaction between you and your furry friend.

There’s also an issue with expeditions. Occasionally, you’ll need to fire an SOS flare to let friends join, which feels clunky and might even be a bug.

The one highlight for me? 
The dragons. They’re absolutely amazing, both in design and presence. I only wish I could capture that adorable baby dragon—it’s a missed opportunity for some serious feels!",False,1421,1421,1733329055,1736507813,0,0

76561198055861332,181657647,"Monster Hunter: World is a masterclass in crafting immersive, living worlds. From the dense forest to the harsh deserts every location feels vibrant and alive. The ecosystem is more than just a backdrop; it's a breathing, dynamic world where monsters follow their own daily routines, unaffected by your presence until the hunt begins. Watching creatures interact with their environment adds a layer of realism that few games can match, making exploration just as exciting as the hunts themselves.

The core of the game lies in its monster hunting, and Capcom has perfected this formula. Every encounter feels unique, challenging, and rewarding. Combat is fluid, responsive, and highly customizable with 14 weapon types, allowing players to find a style that suits them. Hunting alone is satisfying, but teaming up with up to three friends elevates the experience to a whole new level of fun, coordination, and triumph.

Even the base game offers a staggering amount of content, from dozens of monsters to hunt to countless weapons and armor sets to craft. However, what truly sets Monster Hunter: World apart is the Iceborne expansion, a DLC that enhances the game in every way. 

Whether you're a series veteran or a newcomer, World offers something for everyone. It's a game that demands your attention and rewards your dedication. If you've ever been curious about the Monster Hunter franchise, there's no better entry point than World.

76561198119645022,181603380,"If you’ve ever dreamed of being a heroic, sword-wielding monster slayer, Monster Hunter: World is here to make those dreams come true – and then promptly turn them into a sweaty, hilarious nightmare.

This game isn’t just about hunting monsters; it’s about chasing them across massive, gorgeous landscapes, trying not to get squished by their giant feet, and praying your teammates don’t accidentally set you on fire (again). If you’re not laughing at the chaos of battle, you’re probably laughing at yourself as you fumble around trying to catch a monster’s tail... for the tenth time.

The combat is incredibly satisfying, but don't be fooled – it's like learning a new dance. At first, you’ll feel like you're stepping on your own feet, swinging a sword in the wrong direction, and then realizing you’ve been knocked out by a giant angry lizard. But the more you play, the more you start to feel like a seasoned monster-hunting pro (who still gets knocked out by a giant angry lizard, but at least now you know how to dodge it).

The real fun kicks in when you’re hunting in a squad – teamwork is key, and by “teamwork,” I mean “all of you running in different directions, trying to figure out where the monster went, and maybe one of you will accidentally throw a trap down at the wrong time.” But when it all comes together and that giant monster finally falls, there’s no better feeling. It’s like the most satisfying team sport you’ll ever play... except you’re not really sure if your friends are helping or just enjoying the chaos.

So grab your weapon, sharpen your skills (or don’t, we’ll figure it out), and get ready for some of the most epic, hilarious, and slightly embarrassing hunts of your life. Monster Hunter: World isn’t just about slaying monsters – it’s about laughing at how you manage to not slay them the first few times and celebrating the victories when you finally do.

76561198064733262,181589183,"Monster Hunter: World is an exceptional entry in Capcom’s long-running franchise, bringing the series to a wider audience with its debut on modern consoles and PC. The game is set in a lush, living world teeming with exotic creatures, where players take on the role of hunters tasked with tracking and slaying a variety of enormous monsters.
The game’s strength lies in its deep and satisfying gameplay loop. Each hunt feels like a strategic endeavor, requiring players to study monster behavior, craft effective gear, and execute well-timed attacks. The variety of weapons, each with its unique playstyle, adds depth and replayability, ensuring that no two hunts feel the same.
Visually, Monster Hunter: World is stunning. The environments are rich and detailed, and the monsters themselves are incredibly designed, each presenting a unique challenge. The game’s ecosystems feel alive, with creatures interacting in ways that make the world feel dynamic and immersive.
The multiplayer aspect is robust, allowing players to join friends or strangers in their hunts, adding a social dimension that enhances the experience. However, the game does have a steep learning curve, which might be daunting for newcomers. Additionally, some players might find the grind for gear upgrades to be repetitive over time.
Overall, Monster Hunter: World is a triumph for the series, offering an engaging and visually spectacular experience that can hook both veterans and new players alike.",True,7416,7416,1733182194,1733182194,0,0

I will say though, it does require some grinding, but it's totally worth it for what you get out of it - depth, and a lot more reward

This game takes about 50-60 hours to beat the base game and i knew what i was doing. for a complete newbie id say 70-80 hours. i passed on the iceborne expansion as a lot of people were not happy with it. The base game has what i feel would be less monsters than an old PSP game. They left out the tigrex in the base game like come on (thats a staple monster for monster hunter). they also left out lunestra which is pretty much toestras cousin. Not sure why a lot of the base monsters were not added to base game (they most certainly already had models and movesets made for them), i felt like a lot of the old monsters were just scrapped and forgotten about which is kind of sad. some of the old monster fights were fun, and the early monsters in freedom united taught you how to use your weapon. this game has about 2-3 monsters before you fight your first wall (anjaith) which seems a bit tough on the new players. The game doesnt really explain a whole lot unless you go click on everyone and actually interact with folks which i know a lot of new players just want to go hunt and kill things.

Where Dauntless can be a bit too arcade-y, MHW goes in the opposite direction and becomes a bit too heavy and slow. On average you spend probably around 10-15% of a fight being unable to control your character, that is simply way too much.

Between monsters hitting you, screaming every 20 seconds (which stuns you), actual CC effects like paralysis, and your own animations that are just a bit too long to be uninterruptable, you will constantly find yourself unable to move, dodge or otherwise control your character and it all culminates in an experience that is often characterized by annoyance or frustration.

76561198003689310,181247187,"The short Answer is, Yes I recommend this game. Its great fun specially with friend 

This game is loads of fun and I am having a blast playing this with a friend of mine. The monsters are vary imaginative. They are vary well designed. I find the combat engaging. Its pretty awesome when you see two monsters meet up. Yes the game is grindy.  Its not a monotonous Grind. most gear requires Parts from multiple Monsters. 

The bad: WTF were they thinking when they made the multiplayer. Like why can we just play the story line but with two people. Why is this so hard for Developers to do. Some times you can not play with friends because of  cut scenes . So stupid and annoying

The ugly: You can tell this game was made for controler and keyboard and mouse was a distance thought. an after the fact thing. The UI is probably this games biggest downfall. Sure there is quick menus, they are like action bars but you have to press 1 button twice if you want to use something on it. and I absolutely Hate radial menus",True,6014,4135,1733036072,1733036072,0,0

If you like tough games like other souls-like, you will like them. Of course, you don't need to collect souls, you get resources after killing or catching monsters.

Worth to mention:
- You can play multiplayer after the second story mission, and even after that, you cannot play together with your friends 'till each of you watches the story. So it breaks the game feeling. Mostly it looks like this:
Two players run the same mission, the first guy who found the boss leaves the mission and connects to the second player
- You can catch a monster when it walks weirdly or tries to return to his home or sleep. During that, you install a shock trap and two times sleep thing uses, and you will catch

Every detail seemed carefully considered, yet somehow elusive, leaving just enough room for interpretation without ever fully committing to one perspective. The pacing fluctuated between moments of quiet introspection and bursts of frenetic energy, creating a rhythm that felt both intentional and unpredictable.

The characters; or perhaps they were ideas? had an uncanny ability to resonate on a personal level, despite their often ambiguous motivations. The themes, while seemingly universal, danced just beyond the grasp of definitive meaning, inviting the audience to explore interpretations as varied as the colors of a sunset.

Visually, it was a spectacle: subtle yet vibrant, sharp yet blurred. Each element contributed to a larger whole that felt cohesive in its incompleteness. And the conclusion? It lingered, not with answers, but with a sense of wonder that was both satisfying and frustrating, as if to remind you that the journey was more significant than the destination.

In the end, it is an experience that defies easy categorization—a testament to its complexity and a challenge to the conventional expectations of its medium. Would I recommend it?

While the story can be a little bit lacking, the gameplay makes up for it immensely with how intricate and satisfying it is, as well as the depth in its endemic life and interactions between the monsters. If you're starting out with the Monster Hunter franchise this is a good entry to start off with for you to learn on how to play the game and figure out on what weapon you feel comfortable with, just don't use the defender gear as it can ruin the experience (unless you're wanting to skip to the DLC, power to you)

76561199265905416,180628843,"Monster Hunter is probably my favorite game of all time - and I started on the Atari. It has the perfect blend of difficulty, grind, crafting and action.
The grind can cause the occasional rage quit, but it will get you back - the successes are well rewarded, and it actually feels like you're accomplishing something. 
This isn't just your average ""charge in and kick some monster butt by mashing buttons"" games -  of all the Monster Hunter titles, World feels the most like an actual ""hunt."" There isn't any collecting little birds like in Rise to power you up fir *every* hunt (what a waste of time!), you actually have to track the monster, then the fights: Monster Hunter requires the player to take some time to learn the habits of their quarry. Once you've gotten the patterns and ""tells"" down, you can get to work on taking them down. 
Also, there is such a huge variety of weapon types that all sorts of play styles are supported -- whether you like the quick blade action of dual blades, the slower calculation of a great sword, or you prefer to fire at your enemies from afar, there's a weapon to suit all preferences. 
Finally, the graphics...World definitely has the best graphics (on PC, at least), of all the MH series. The armor and weapons you craft actually show on your character, and the mechanics aren't sloppy. Hit boxes may cause frustration at times, but hey, I never said it would be easy!

The monster before me stumbles, its once-mighty form now trembling from the force of my previous onslaught. The ground beneath our feet quakes as I steady my stance, feeling the pulse of power rise within me like a storm ready to break.

“This ends now,” I mutter under my breath, my grip tightening around the hilt.

I begin my charge, my movements a blur, as I prepare for my ultimate strike. One... two... three... My shoulder slams into the beast with the force of a mountain, sending it crashing backward, its body splintering the earth. The creature bellows in fury, but it’s already staggered, its defenses crumbling beneath the weight of my assault.

One... two... three... Another shoulder tackle—this time, faster, more vicious. I feel the shockwave reverberate through my bones as the monster stumbles again, its head spinning from the brutal impact. It’s struggling to rise, gasping for breath, but it is weak—and I know this is my moment.

The air crackles with energy, the world slowing around me as I prepare for my final, crushing blow. One... two... three... The ground beneath my feet seems to pulse with the rhythm of my charge. Every muscle in my body screams as I summon the last vestiges of my strength. My Greatsword gleams with an eerie, crimson glow, its edge hungry for blood.

With a roar that echoes through the heavens, I swing my weapon, the force of the blow capable of rending mountains. The first strike connects—but the monster is still reeling, still dazed. This is it. The BIG swing—the moment that will determine everything.

My body coils, my sword swings in an arc so fast that it shreds the very air. The blade hums with power, glowing with the fury of a thousand storms, as it descends upon the monster’s exposed form.

it definitely should not be a mandatory mechanic that the game imposes on the player.

If you haven't played a Monster Hunter game before then this is a great entry point to the series because it has a lot of quality of life improvements compared to older entries, it's still well populated by people (though getting friends into the game is preferable), and it's so cheap on sale.

I personally prefer Rise to World as I like the extra mobility in that game with riding Palamutes and zipping around with wirebugs. I also love the mounted combat to make monsters fight and it has my boy, Magnamalo. World also has some things that get in the way of my enjoyment. I hate the clutch claw that Iceborne introduces. It's necessary to not make fights take forever but it has horrible aiming and reach and I feel like it breaks the flow of the combat. I think some of the maps are awkward to navigate and scoutflies just get in the way more than leading me to the target. There's clawshot ammo everywhere so if you try to pick up a material before it despawns you'll probably accidentally pick up some stones instead.

But overall it's a load of fun. It's super satisfying taking down a new monster, palicoes are cute as ever, making new armour and weapons is rewarding, and all of it is better if you can hunt with a pal or three.

[b]Rating:[/b] ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (5/5)

After 52 hours in Monster Hunter: World (MHW), it's clear that this game offers an amazing and rewarding experience. As someone currently in the middle of the game, I'm constantly impressed by the intensity and fun of the hunts. While I’m not yet in the endgame, the journey so far has been incredibly enjoyable. Here's why Monster Hunter: World has captured my attention:

[hr][/hr]

[h2]Gameplay - Addictive and Tactically Demanding[/h2]
At its core, Monster Hunter: World is about the thrill of the hunt. Each monster presents a unique challenge that requires strategy, precision, and patience. There’s a wide variety of weapons, each offering different playstyles – from the fast and agile dual blades to the heavy and slow greatsword. Even at my current stage, I’m constantly discovering new ways to approach battles, and each monster feels like a puzzle to solve. The combat is rewarding and deep, with plenty of room for growth as you learn more about each monster's behavior and weaknesses.

[hr][/hr]

[h2]World Design - Stunning and Diverse[/h2]
The environments in Monster Hunter: World are breathtaking. From lush jungles to dry deserts, each biome feels alive, filled with unique ecosystems and diverse monsters. It's easy to get lost in these beautiful areas, and the world feels immersive. Whether hunting or gathering resources, the world is rich in detail and has a purpose behind every element. The sense of scale and beauty makes exploring the game’s world a pleasure.

[hr][/hr]

[h2]Multiplayer - Teamwork is Key[/h2]
While the game is great solo, playing with friends really elevates the experience. The multiplayer mode encourages cooperation, with each hunter playing a crucial role in the hunt. It’s so much fun to team up with friends and take down tougher monsters together. Plus, comparing loot afterward and seeing who got the best rewards adds an extra layer of excitement.

[hr][/hr]

[h2]Progression - Steady and Rewarding[/h2]
Progression in Monster Hunter: World is addictive. Every successful hunt leads to better gear, and upgrading weapons and armor feels immensely satisfying. As I continue to level up and improve my equipment, the game introduces new monsters, challenges, and strategies. The loot system is highly engaging, as you constantly look for specific monster parts to craft better gear, and the crafting options are vast and offer many different possibilities.

[h2]Final Thoughts - A Fantastic Journey So Far[/h2]
Monster Hunter: World is a brilliantly designed game that offers an excellent experience from the start. Even with my 52 hours in, I’m still thrilled by the variety, challenge, and depth of the game. While I’m not in the endgame yet, the journey so far has been incredibly fun, and I look forward to what’s to come!

Dozens of monsters to hunt.  Food to eat.  Cats to to dress up.  Monster Hunter World is the best of the Monster Hunter series.  Monster Hunter World is a top 10 in the third-person action game.  You can beat the game in 30 hours.  Or play for 1000 hours.  I still haven't finish (2 monsters left).  Not bad for $20

It's a phenomenon that us monster hunter fans only dreamed of. Before world nobody knew about this s***. I couldn't be happier than Capcom invested into making this a reality. 
The gameplay is so good that you don't even need a story, it's just there. The premise is to hunt monsters, use their material to craft armor that resembles both their looks and fighting style. And as you do this you're mastering your weapon, intuition, creativity, and by end game each encounter feels like a dance. Then you decide to pickup a new weapon to learn and you're living the journey all over again. 
Everything about the game is visually engaging. The environments are so vibrant and diverse, and the way the hunts blend into them through interactive elements only adds to the immersion. The design and animation of the monsters will invoke emotions and test your combative intuition. The weapons and gear look so badass that you'll want to grind monsters you hate just to get them.

MHWorld is a masterpiece that brings together stunning visuals, immersive environments, and deep, strategic gameplay. The game’s vast open world, filled with dynamic ecosystems and colossal monsters, offers endless exploration and excitement. The combat system is incredibly rewarding, challenging players to master a variety of weapons, each with its own unique playstyle. Whether you’re hunting solo or teaming up with friends, the thrill of taking down massive beasts never gets old. The attention to detail, from the monsters' behavior to the environmental interactions, makes Monster Hunter: World an unforgettable experience that truly redefines action RPGs.

Personally, This game quickly became one of my all-time favorite soul devouring game. In addition to playing it with your friends will give that sense of accomplishment after taking down a massive monster, especially after a tough battle, is unmatched. I love how every hunt feels unique, with the monsters behaving differently depending on the environment and the strategy you bring to the fight. The co-op multiplayer is fantastic too; teaming up with friends to hunt down huge creatures always leads to epic moments. The world itself is just breathtaking, and the depth of customization—from gear to playstyles—keeps me coming back for more every time. It’s a game that truly lets you get lost in its world.

76561198185044234,179977739,"I like Monster Hunter a lot. I started on generations ultimate, and I have pretty decent hours in generations ultimate and over 600 in Rise. MH:W has a lot that I like about it, and it has a high level of quality. Ultimately, though, I wouldn't recommend it. I'm not gonna bother ragging on the whole ""watch cutscene before multiplayer"" deal, everyone already knows about that and dislikes it.
Gonna start with the good: combat is fun. I like how the monsters feels in this game, I like how the weapons feel in this game, I enjoy the combat. It's monster hunter. Weapons feel like they pack a punch, monsters are challenging and engaging to fight against. Second: this game is obviously pretty. Though, I find this to be somewhat of a double-edged blade.
Now, the bad: I find this game's overall structure and pacing to be horrendous. I feel that in general, Monster Hunter works so well for me because of the more ""classic"" monster hunter structure: the game gives you large batches of quests at a time with no particular completion order, with a certain amount of them being required to complete to progress to the next rank. This help give the games a very charming psuedo-MMO kinda feel, and allows you to largely play at your own pace/whim. This game has completely axed that, instead mostly giving you one quest at a time to complete, rarely two or three. It feels like you're being pretty constantly railroaded into playing the way the writers want you too, and that feeling is very antithetical to the design philosophy that I think works for this game. Additionally, there's so many required ""missions"" or expeditions that will consist of minutes of slowly walking behind an NPC and listening to them talk about whatever is happening in the story (a story which isn't nearly well-baked enough to justify the attention it's given). The ""required progressions"" bits of this game honestly feel like a 2:1 ratio of walking/listening/watching cutscenes to actually hunting monsters. It is such a massive slog. It also doesn't help that half the maps in the game (ancient forest especially) are very poorly designed and both difficult and uninteresting to navigate. Nothing like a monster fleeing in hunt and spending the next 3 minutes traveling annoyingly vertically across an already horizontally massive map.
Circling back to the prettiness of the game, I actually really think it can be a negative at times. For starters, this game is pretty notoriously underoptimized and still has consistent performance issues on decent-but-not-fantastic PCs (as of late 2024). But aside from performance issues that have gotten less aggressive as time goes on, the ""prettiness"" of the game leads to some gameplay consequences. Environments that are packed with excessive amounts of flora combined with gratuitous processing effects lead to very poor visibility in a game where you're punished dramatically for losing focus on the monster you're fighting. While this game might sell itself to some on the point that its environment is more immersive (though, in my opinion, the aggressive Main Character Syndrome writing and horrible railroad-y pacing undermine that immersion in comparison to older titles), there's a reason maps in older games occasionally felt more like environmentally-themed collections of boss arenas. 
All in all, the game is fun. If you haven't played any Monster Hunter before, there's a decent chance you'll enjoy it. But I can't recommend it.",False,3178,3085,1732733551,1732733551,6,2

If you’ve ever dreamed of being dropped into Jurassic Park with a sword the size of a canoe and told, “Good luck!” then Monster Hunter: World is the game for you. Capcom has whipped up a wild ride that’s equal parts visually stunning, mechanically deep, and occasionally rage-inducing—but in the best way possible.

The All-You-Can-Hunt Buffet
This game serves up so much content that you’ll need a doggy bag. The environments are breathtaking, with enough flora and fauna to make a nature documentary jealous. Whether you’re chasing down a Tobi-Kadachi or desperately trying to avoid being dinner for a Bazelgeuse, every moment feels like it could end up in a National Geographic highlight reel—or your obituary.

Mechanics: Like Juggling Chainsaws… Gracefully
Combat in Monster Hunter: World is a beautiful dance of chaos and precision. Every swing, dodge, and accidental faceplant feels impactful. And don’t even get me started on the grappling hook—it’s like Spider-Man had a midlife crisis and decided to hunt dragons instead of saving New York.

Monsters: Scary, Sassy, and Stunning
The monsters are the true stars here. Each one has its own quirks and personality. There’s the fire-spitting Anjanath, who looks like a T-Rex with a flamethrower upgrade, and then there’s the Arch-Tempered Velkhana, a creature so majestic it could headline a winter Olympics opening ceremony—if it wasn’t busy turning you into a human popsicle.

Weapons: 14 Flavors of Pain
There are 14 weapon types, each more complicated than your average tax return. Want to swing a hammer the size of a small car? Go for it. Feel like channeling your inner Samurai with a Long Sword? Why not? And then there’s the Hunting Horn, which lets you whack monsters over the head while playing the greatest hits. Learning even one weapon takes dedication. Learning all 14? You might want to quit your day job.

The Struggle Is Real
Make no mistake: this game is hard. But it’s the kind of hard that makes your victories taste sweeter than a post-hunt BBQ platter. That first time you topple a Nergigante after a dozen failed attempts, you’ll feel like you’ve conquered Mount Everest—except Everest wasn’t trying to impale you with its tail.

Verdict: Worth Every Bruise
Monster Hunter: World is like a chaotic, adrenaline-filled safari where you’re both the hunter and the hunted. It’s frustrating, thrilling, and ridiculously fun all at once. If you’re ready to face massive beasts, master ridiculous weapons, and cry over fainting two seconds before victory, then this game will sink its claws into you—and you’ll laugh while it does.

This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he let me borrow his controller. Me and my son then played in turns and I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died.

Another 50hrs for Iceborne (to reach the ""credit rolling"" boss in Master Rank).
And I think I probably pour another hundreds of hours into this game. Unless Wilds somehow discounted quicker than World.

I mean I don't know what to write for this review. I'm a veteran that played MH since PSP era, pouring thousands of hours spanning across 4 games, Freedom, Freedom 2, Freedom Unite and Portable 3rd. I didn't had money for later iterations so I just jumped from 3rd to World, quite a leap ain't it?

I mean there're a lot of QoL improvements compared to 3rd (well.. how many years between them again, duh?).
But the core game is still the same. You took the quest, went in the map, tracking down the monster to hunt and try to hunt them down or capture, you finished the quest and back to the village. Rinse and Repeat.

I think for casual player, the base game probably fine for most of them. You can pour like hundreds of hours into it.
If you already bored or in need of another ""extensions"" that could drag you much, much longer then Iceborne it is.

My only gripe with Iceborne is how steep in difficulty between High ranked (baseline game) and Master Rank (Iceborne) is, rendering the old ""top tier"" high rank armor basically ""useless"" (I mean it's ""double"" the defense in Master Rank).

76561199193723435,179836320,"When I first dove into Monster Hunter: World, I wasn’t entirely sure what to expect. Sure, I’d heard the hype about the franchise, but nothing could prepare me for the pure joy of tracking, fighting, and conquering massive, beautifully designed monsters. This game quickly became one of my favorite co-op experiences—and even as a solo adventure, it’s a blast.

The Gameplay Loop: A Satisfying Grind  
At its core, Monster Hunter: World nails the hunt-and-reward formula. You hunt monsters, carve them up for parts, and use those materials to craft gear to tackle even tougher monsters. Every hunt feels unique, thanks to the diverse environments and monster behaviors. Tracking down a Rathalos or battling a Nergigante is a thrilling mix of strategy, timing, and adrenaline. 

The grind could have gotten repetitive, but the sheer variety of weapons, monsters, and ecosystems kept me hooked. I spent hours experimenting with weapon types—my favorites ended up being the Great Sword and the Dual Blades, both offering similar playstyles.

Multiplayer: The Heart of the Experience  
This game shines brightest when playing with friends. Teaming up to take down a massive Elder Dragon or bailing each other out with healing items mid-hunt is a blast. The SOS flare system is a godsend for solo players looking to quickly join others or get some backup. I loved how intuitive the multiplayer setup was, though I did run into the occasional hiccup with session stability. That said, nothing beats the camaraderie of a well-coordinated hunt with friends.

Mods: Expanding the Adventure  
The modding community for Monster Hunter: World is fantastic and adds so much replayability to the game. While I stuck with quality-of-life mods at first—like better UI improvements and damage meters—I eventually branched out into more fun, wacky ones. There’s something hilarious about replacing a Great Jagras with Shrek or running around in an over-the-top anime skin. For more serious players, mods that tweak monster behavior or add custom quests can really freshen up the experience. If you’re on PC, mods are definitely worth exploring.

Summary: 
Monster Hunter: World has something for everyone. The core gameplay is rock solid, the multiplayer is a blast, and the mods add an extra layer of fun. If you’re looking for a game where teamwork and skill meet spectacle, this is it. I’ve spent countless hours with it and still feel like there’s more to discover every time I log in.",True,2177,2177,1732608703,1732608703,2,0

76561198271018960,179828619,"First of all, I came from this game after playing Rise (on Switch then PC) for several hours and felt kinda meh. So guess what, I decided to try the older one, which is World.
Now you know that my review is not based on the even older MH series, here it is:

THE GOOD
1. Variety of weapons, each with almost completely different mechanics.
2. Still active online community (hopefully still even after Wilds release).
3. Satisfying combat. Repetitive yes but it feels good when landing hits or when you can finally get used to certain weapons that you like.
4. I love Character levelling system, so I thought i wouldn't like Equipment based progression system of World but Man i was wrong. So many possibilities with builds and afaik many builds are viable instead of only one or two.
5. Palicoes! and i can even dress mine!


THE NEUTRAL
1. I expect more of monster varieties. I mean, this game will even be fine if titled Dino/Dragon Hunter because i think 90% of them are modifications of either dinosaurs or dragons. I kinda expect fighting spider monster or  wolf or cats or ghosts.
2. The difficulty is beyond me (i need to GIT GUD!), so many of my assigned quests are helped by strangers, so I can farm their materials, forge better weapons and armors, then i can help others on their assigned quests. 
3. The ranged weapons are so hard to use with controller, I end up using mouse to aim and controller to move which of course didn't work.

THE MEH
1. I have Omen laptop with ryzen 7 5800H, 3070, 32Gb, and sometimes there are random freezes for several seconds and the AA looks kinda horrible. I play at 1080p with settings mostly med-high, 90fps capped. Maybe this game is not well optimized?
2. I don't hate the clutch claw and tenderize mechanic but if only they're made as alternatives to open more possibilities when fighting monsters instead of them being compulsory.
3. Why do they limit the number of some items in the pouch? is it for realism reason?
4. I still kinda wish we can at least upgrade our character's based hp and stamina when leveling up rank.
5. the multiplayer system is a little bit complicated compared to games like Diablo or Borderlands for example.

I will not buy Wilds after several years and it got the master edition and heavily discounted so I will keep playing this for a while. If anyone wants to play with me kindly add me but pls bring your mid game Iceborne weapons (i'm currently using Rarity 10 DB and lance) so you won't one shot the monsters.
and btw, if we use SUNRISE then this one is ICEWORLD instead of worldborne (what kind of name is that).

Originally got the Xbox One version as my first game in the series a few months after release, and friends suggested to play together. If you're an old fan, [b] highly [/b] suggest you get the base game + Iceborne bundle, but if you're new, try out the base game before getting the DLC.
Singleplayer wise for the story, it's a great experience if you're looking for a smaller focus on an in depth story, and just want to [u] hunt [/u] the [u] monsters. [/u] Though for multiplayer (up to 4 players in a quest) it's a lot more complicated, in which you'll have to watch (or most of the time walk to/search and activate) the cutscene before anyone will be able to join you, and since that applies to everyone, you'll either have to leave the quest after watching the cutscene, or have your friend(s) do that instead, which can get annoying. Even with that problem, since monster health scales with the player count, you or your friends shouldn't join too late to ruin a potential first time hunt, if you're [b] not [/b] using Guardian Armor/Defender Weapons in the base game.
Gameplay wise for new players, there's 14 different weapons to choose from, arguably fitting any playstyle you'd have in mind, along with having the option to switch weapons if the one you picked isn't sticking. For the grind for new weapons and armor, unfortunately it could scale from taking only a few hunts of the same monster, to going a whole sitting without getting everything you need. If you're struggling with that, it's best to use the 'Investigation' quests you unlock soon into the game, which is explained in more detail either in game, or a quick internet search.
To sum everything up, couldn't suggest this game more from a PvE game lover's standpoint, especially if you have free time on your hands. I already have MHWilds pre ordered and plan to sink even more hours into it lol",True,63068,62284,1732584427,1732584427,4,0

76561198002568562,179816405,"Possibly one of the best PvE games ever made. It's crazy just how much value you can pull out of this one game. What I think makes this work is the core combat, along with the different weapons. Monsters are complex enough that you will feel personal growth as you learn all their attacks. Some weapons are pretty easy to use and some will get better as you get better and understand your opponent. This means that you can have a very low effort, chill time but you can also challenge yourself to learn something new and more technical. You've always got some goal to work towards, some new armor you want to make or weapon you want to optimize. And once you've done that, multiplayer can add a new layer of gameplay as every time you join someone to help you don't know what you're going to get. Some people don't really need help but other times you have to carry hard. And, on top of that, the game has a strong modding community, so you can replay the game in very different ways. There's even huge mods that overhaul nearly the entire game and feel almost like a 2nd expansion.

This is one of those games where you are technically doing the same thing over and over but the thing you are doing is so much fun you want to keep going. Sheer variety in weapons, armors and items can keep you trying out new things for ages before you get bored.

One of the best experiences that i've ever had playing videogames even.

I wish Capcom would port the older titles to Steam so that i could have a hassle free way of playing them with friends.
I really do wanna play some Freedom Unite, 3U, 4U or Gen U some way without resorting to emulation.

I'd buy, play them for hundreds of hours, make some good memories of hunting with friends and recommend them to anyone if Capcom were willing to not lock them away on dead consoles with no online. Most likely they will only continue making new ones and ignore the old. Here's hoping i'm wrong.

So, what is this game good at if it has a weak storyline, boring characters, and mundane conversations? This is a good hunting game where you just go out and look for a monster to hammer. The combat itself is very satisfying, and each weapon is so unique that you feel like you are playing a different game whenever you change your weapon of choice. You're not supposed to rush to finish this game as soon as you can. This is the kind of game where you can just log in for 30 minutes, hunt a monster, and then close it afterward, revisiting it whenever you feel like it.

Lancer has way too many skill effect requirements to be valid until extremely late in the game so I don't recommend picking it. Otherwise you're taking damage through block, getting flinched and pushed back when blocking, getting your attacks interrupted by teammates, and doing poor damage.

76561198032657667,179713837,"I had 1000+ hours on my PS4 Pro, 
Playing it for the first time, i couldn't get the point of the game for about 20 hours because i never got the hang of how the Charge Blade really works, (i used the Sword and Shield mode without buffing) 
But then, slowly, i started getting what Monster Hunter was about, with each hunt, with each investigation, i fell more and more in love with this game.
I played this game basically for all my free time, a lot of sleepless nights
and that kind of thing never happened to me before, never has a game held such a tight grip on me for multiple days, weeks, months.
And then Iceborne released, and at first i thought that i will not put my life on pause again, like i did with the base game, and i couldn't be more wrong
Monster Hunter did it again, and the DLC was arguably even better than the base game.
It's truly a marvel how the dev team managed to do it again
I know it was mine, and many others' game of the year of 2018
Replaying it again was amazing 
The magic of Monster Hunter is still there, and probably will always be there, 
even after so many hours played
And to be honest, i couldn't even put my finger on what makes this game so special to me 
Is it the the amazing Combat? Music? Characters? Armor? Weapons? Story? Monsters that you fight?  
It is simply magic, and the amount of love the devs put into this game and it's expansion is felt throughout
Thank you Monster Hunter
Best of wishes to the amazing talents at Capcom and Monster Hunter developers!
Hope they will knock it out of the park again with Monster Hunter: Wilds

You can play solo in this game, but I dont recommend it. Go find a friend or make some friends. Believe me, it will change your life because its so much fun!!

You can hunt every monster and must learn the learning curve, the mechanics, and studies. Every monster has their own weaknesses, which is fantastic. 
From beginner to a pro hunter, shall we? Just dont giveup! Lol

I love every monster in this game: Rajang, Brachy, Velkhana, Teo, Fatalis, Safi, etc.

The hardest game I played so far, the grinding never gets boring because you can be yourself, you can capture endemic life, you can make your own guild (team), you got your own safe house, and the best thing ever, you can also make new friends in any region, any language, etc. 

The soundtrack: Great
The Gameplay: Superb
The Story: Okay
The Graphic: Amazing
Dont forget the collaboration and also the quest.

Btw, I love DarkSouls games such as Bloodborne etc, but this game is another lever mate.

U can solo every boss in the Dark Souls game. Its too easy for me, but if u wanna solo the monsters in the MH series, u need balls like iron mates. Im just telling you the truth, no offense.

See u there, hunter!
Enjoy the game!

It can get a bit grindy when you're trying to break a certain part to get a resources for some armor or a weapon, and when you're out finding materials for consumables, but grinding is mostly optional (it just makes it easier).

It can get hard too, especially when fighting with monsters with weird hitboxes because some enemies (like the anjanath) can hit you with certain attacks while you're visually not in it's range (like standing behind or next to it when it charges at you or does a side-lunge). 

But otherwise the game has very little flaws IMO, and runs pretty well with no gamebreaking bugs. Most of the glitches that happened were because I was panicking and sending so many inputs that I got stuck in an animation. Or some visual and audio bugs.

Also one thing thats not a huge flaw, but is just annoying, is that I cant move while attacking with my favorite weapon, the switch-axe. But honestly its not a terrible thing and is a good downside for an otherwise great weapon.",True,1537,1047,1732325723,1732325723,0,0

Would highly recommend this game to anyone who loves to revel in the ambiance of digital forests, deserts, tundras, etc. The sound design of the monsters and other critters is really amazing, it feels like you are actually tracking and researching these fascinating Monsters. 🐾🏞️

Coming to the controls and combat part of the game, if you are familiar with Monster Hunter games, then it doesn't need to be said that the freedom of weapon options is amazing, 14 different weapon classes each with their own detailed combos + clutch claw mechanics. 

Some monsters like Elder Dragons (especially Lunastra, (actually the crown would go to Raging Brachy) ) pose a real challenge, but everything is fine as long as you steadily learn the monster's combos, weakening body parts, using the environment to your benefit and most importantly, being comfortable with your choice of weapon.

76561198108278202,179494818,"I am 32 years old.

My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and we adopted our son together. Both are now 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I felt lost and unhappy. I was self-destructive. One day, I was so angry with everything spiraling out of control that I punched a concrete wall in a moment of overwhelming emotion. This resulted in breaking my fifth metacarpal in my right hand—the hand I worked with, played games with, and used to carry my children to bed—the hand I desperately needed to ensure I could continue providing.

Upon learning the severity of the self-inflicted damage, I became almost suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man, with no history of depression or anxiety. I had never experienced anger outbursts, nor was I the type to break down and cry, but I was in a tough situation that truly prevented me from seeing the light on the other side.

With nothing better to do, I looked for a game I could play WITH ONE HAND while recovering. Somehow, I stumbled upon this game and read some of the comments. I decided it was worth a try... I must admit I didn't beat the game, nor did I play as much as some of you. In fact, I may have played this game for only a day or two. That being said, after doing so, I had a new joy and hope for life. I managed to leave behind the pain and suffering that had been thrust upon me. I could experience the joy and happiness of other people. I relaxed for 5 ♥♥♥♥ minutes listening to this music, long enough to realize that I would be okay.

After realizing this, I turned off the game and went back to work. My hand hurt a lot, but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so sorry for myself and became the father I needed to be at that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving like.

Today, I am close friends with the mother of my children. We don't fight, argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents and friends.

Now I have 3 children. My third child is, wait, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my separation, and we just unexpectedly stumbled into each other's lives. We have been dating for a year and are very happy together.

Moral of the story: you never know what life has in store for you, and if I had given up when all odds were against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.

76561199054825749,179454693,"As a huge Soulslike enjoyer I was looking forward to playing Monster Hunter World, but so far I have experienced nothing but frustration. Now, I am aware that this is not a SoulsLike, but what I was looking for was a similarly addicting gameplay loop and satisfying combat, and I have found none of those two things. My main issue with Monster Hunter World is its steep learning curve and the exceptionally poor job it does at explaining to you both how its many convoluted systems work and why each of them is important. Now, a ""mess around, find out"" approach to teaching game mechanics and systems can work wonders in creating a natural learning experience WHEN said mechanics and systems are simple enough, the best example being, you guessed it, FromSoftware's souls games. Their core gameplay loop of lock-on combat with dodge/block & attack as the fundamentals is simple enough that a few dev messages strewn about the tutorial area or a few pop-ups are enough to teach players the basics, and the other systems are naturally woven into the following hours, but they're never thrown at the player at an overwhelming pace. Monster Hunter World takes a similar approach, but fails in this regard because it is not a game rooted in a simple, but layered gameplay loop, it is a chonky, system-based game, and all it does is throw a bajillion mechanics and systems at you before you can even get accustomed to the core gameplay loop and lets you mess around and maybe figure them out, and if you don't figure them out or even forget altogether about things like crafting, whose importance is never emphasized by the way, well then good luck I guess. Another big problem I have is the core gameplay loop. I am sure there is a lot of enjoyment to be found with it after lucking your way through the myriad of systems and dense menuing, and figuring out the chonky combat and weapon movesets, but the early game has been nothing but brute-forcing monsters and chasing them around while they retreat, only to periodically stumble upon annoying ganks, and the monsters being overall extremely erratic plus the lack of I-frames on dodges makes the whole combat experience just not click at all with me, not to mention the constant pace-breaking chases I have to give and having to constantly repair my weapon, it's frustrating and annoying more than anything. And finally, the map design, it has been either extremely linear monster-hunting quests or expeditions that consisted of me running around in circles because everything looks the same in the open world wilderness and the map is absolutely awful, with no sense of direction or topography. While I can see how this game might eventually become super rewarding and addicting for players willing to invest the time, my experience as someone new to the series has been overwhelmingly frustrating, and I am not willing to pour god knows how many hours of confusion, annoyance, dense and unintuitive menuing and frustrating chases, just to begin to enjoy a game when I can spend that time playing other games that do a better job at respecting my time and good will.",False,174,174,1732136974,1732136974,3,1

76561198144909017,179448012,"Well, let's start with the positives...

- A massive and interesting world to explore, lovely to look at and amazing variety in both weapons and monsters
- A game heavily focused on deep combat mechanics and numerous ways to deal with monsters in general
- A lovely character creator which I personally love in every RPG
- Sick looking armor pieces and if you are willing to put the hours into it, the game keeps you busy for an extended amount of time

Now the negatives I am CONSTANTLY struggling with:

- The game is good and fun in the first 20 - 50 hours. The game keeps you engaged with its numerous mechanics and possibilities ~ which is massively overwhelming and poorly explained in the game itself, ESPECIALLY for newcomers.
- The controls feel absolute alien to anyone used to other games where for example X or RB is your light attack and Y / RT is your heavy attack. The controls in this game feels more kin to a beatem'up like Dragonball FighterZ or Soul Calibur.
- The greatest flaw in my opinion: This game does its best to ACTIVELY waste your time... Once you get to the higher ranks or even master rank especially. Monsters keep running away, other great monsters chime in at the MOST unconvenient times, Constant roars, winds, probably even just a gentle breeze of wind keeps your character locked in place and animation. Basically: If an Elder Dragon ignites its ""enraged mode"" you are done playing the game... Put down the controller, make yourself some coffee, smoke a cigarette, heck - start to write a book! Because you won't be able to play the game for a couple of minutes until everything around you calms down again. Your character will be busy flying, flinging, falling and stumbling around as if there was no tomorrow. 
- Essentially, it is probably rightfully called the best multiplayer experience ~ IF you have friends, that is. If you plan to play alone then you are better off playing games that LET you play and DON'T actively waste your time.

Sure, I WANT to enjoy the game, I would LOVE to experience the joy of crafting nice looking armor and weapons and I do have above 100 hours at the point of writing this review. And I actually would be thrilled to recommend this game to you. But if you are - like me - a latecomer to this game and don't bring a couple of friends initially, then you will find yourself ripping your hair and smashing your controller or keyboard.

Most likely a wonderful game for summer holidays, vacations, etc. but for a working person that has around 2 hours of free time to play every day... just don't. Don't put yourself into this neverending spiral of despair and anger...",True,15437,6612,1732130987,1732132826,0,0

76561198112323153,179417790,"Long time fan of the series.  Been playing since Monster Hunter Freedom on the PSP, so I'm quite familiar with the series. 
 This is my second time with MHW.  I first got on the PS4 during the pandemic and I wasn't impressed or pulled in by it.  It was overly enamored with the whole ""Monster Hunter Biologist"" vibe, and was at a really slow boil compared to other MH titles.  I decided to buy it on sale and...yeah...same problems as before.  It just isn't clicking for me.

It's not horrible, but it feels like the game wants to be ponderous and realistic and sort of more meaningful then it can be when my dinner is served to me by dancing cats.  Of course, the entire series has always taken itself too seriously...but that always felt like part of the joke.  MHW felt like it was designed by someone who didn't realize it was supposed to be campy.  So everything is more considered over loaded and you can't do anything at all without getting a mini-tutorial dumped in your face that vomits words at you while explaining nothing.  I can't just hunt dinosaur dragons because it's interesting and they're dangerous; now I need to know why.  Ehhhhh....

I went to join the on-line play as soon as I could...and there wasn't any on-line play I could do.  The game took the time to tell me I could access a mode where I couldn't actually do much of anything?  What's the point in that?

Meanwhile, I go over the Monster Hunter Rise?  Still campy, but it's self aware.  I'm a ninja monster hunter.  Why am I hunting monsters?  Because there are big monsters out there, that's why.  I'll go out with my ninja dog, ninja cat, ninja bird, and ninja bugs and do ninja stuff at monsters until they die and another monster shows up.  The tutorials are just as bloated and stupid...but it's a lot easier to figure things out intuitively.  Even if you can't?  You can actually get into the game play when the game tells you the mode is open; it doesn't bait and switch you by saying that a game mode is open but then offering you a game mode where nothing is unlocked to play

I'm not going to return it, because I love this franchise...but MHW's user friendliness is abysmal...and YES I absolutely know how weird that sounds, given all the quality of life improvements this title represented.  I would have given up the lack of quality of life improvements for the familiarity of a game that let me get in over my head if I was capable of coming out alive!  I don't often like challenging games, so this feels weird to say....but I like it when MH just gets out of my way and let's me sink or swim on my own terms..  

I've seen reviews suggest that Rise is an inferior title...but I don't agree; World feels more polished, to be sure, but it doesn't seem to be lined up with the things I love best about the series.

Overall, I recommend the game...but I don't think it's the exmplar of the series that others make it out to be.",True,87,87,1732096004,1732096004,0,0

76561198125738220,179415490,"debated buying this game for years, got it for 10 dollars during the sale. I really think this game lacks a lot of fluidity for multiplayer but is really solid if you are going it alone. That being said this game really needs some shoe shine to fix and polish its more rough features such as character customization is locked behind a dlc you can use once. Something thats big for me is character customization and this game has high chances to really fuck up your face. Another issue is ""mogging"" or ""transmogging"" which put simply is changing the appearance of your armor and weapons. Now this game does it ALMOST right but still lacks the ability to make your character look the part of a badass who hunts down large creatures. You kinda look goofy through the first 100 hours IM GUESSSING. But overall those are small gripes.

The combat is fresh feeling but sometimes a little janky depending on weapons types. Easily enough something like this would be less important to someone who gets tired of pressing the same 3 buttons in an order. I did enjoy this game with lots of interest and I do hope that this franchise marks itself as a more ONLINE experience. For now though I think its maybe sells 20-30 dollars release and 10 dollars after a couple years. Which is why I never payed full price to begin with. I did enjoy my short playthrough and may play more in the future however with wilds coming out and world not being touched I think its safe to say I wont be milking anymore content from this game.

76561198079732920,179383575,"I highly recommend this game. This game, without trying to sound like a pretentious arts major, is in fact, a work of art. Through and through not only through the high resolution pack that comes with the game but through the presentation and dynamics of full biomes with local fauna and creatures of every size functioning in their own unique ecosystem. Stepping into this world is truly breathtaking.

I have played through the first arc of this game, being the Zorah Magdaros arc, once through PS5 and once through PC. I used the defender armor on the PS5 and various monster armor throughout the PC playthrough and I must say; Playing the game with vs. without the defender armor are two completely separate games. In good conscience I cannot recommend using the defender armor nor the weapons unless you're starting a new save as a veteran and you want to blitz through the game to get to the Iceborne dlc. 

If you're playing the game for the first time the best thing that I can recommend for you to do is to play the game as slowly as you can. You will eventually be able to hunt the cooler and bigger monsters but you can take your time getting there. This is definitely one those games that it's just as much about the journey as it is about the gameplay and the various mechanics of the game. The best parts about this game are discovering a new monster to only get your ass handed to you and have to go back and hunt a different monster for a better stat line to hunt the new monster that's beating you down. Using the defender gear completely removes those types of interactions from the game for a chunk of the game. Well into the Iceborne dlc itself. Monster Hunter World excels when you're constantly engaging with the mechanics of crafting gear and weapons to build against various monsters. 

TLDR; Gorgeous looking game that runs well and if it doesn't for you there a free mods that can be easily installed and acquired to help improve performance on any and all PCs. If you're a veteran looking to get that itch scratched before Wilds releases now is the perfect time to get back into the swing of things. If you're someone who tried out the beta for Wilds and are wanting to get more of that fill than Worlds is the game for you. If you're a returning player I recommend the defender gear just until you finish the first arc and then continue from there. If you're trying this game for the first time I could not recommend starting the game using the standard weapons and gear and then building your way up anymore. The true Monster Hunter experience is the journey from starting at nothing to becoming the best that there ever has been. Pick this game up if you can.",True,3541,3082,1732043483,1732043483,0,0

76561198196852109,179227385,"Monster Hunter World is a game that sets the bar high for action-adventure experiences. Here's why you should dive into this incredible world:

1. Visually Stunning and Immersive World
The game transports you to a lush, vibrant ecosystem teeming with life. Each environment, from dense jungles to arid deserts, is meticulously crafted, making exploration a visually stunning experience. The attention to detail in both the landscapes and the creatures inhabiting them is nothing short of breathtaking.

2. Exhilarating Combat System
Monster Hunter World excels in its combat mechanics. Every weapon class offers a unique playstyle, and the game rewards strategy and skill. The thrill of battling enormous, powerful monsters, each with its own behavior and attack patterns, is an adrenaline-pumping experience that keeps you on your toes.

3. Cooperative Multiplayer
Hunting monsters alone is exhilarating, but teaming up with friends or other players worldwide takes the excitement to another level. The cooperative multiplayer experience fosters teamwork and camaraderie, making each hunt a shared adventure filled with memorable moments.

4. Deep Customization
The game offers extensive customization options for both your character and your equipment. Crafting new gear from the parts of the monsters you’ve defeated adds a rewarding layer of progression, allowing you to tailor your playstyle and appearance to your liking.

5. Continuous Content Updates
Capcom has shown great support for Monster Hunter World through regular content updates and expansions. Events, new monsters, and additional challenges keep the game fresh and engaging long after the initial playthrough.

6. Engaging Storyline
While Monster Hunter games have traditionally focused on gameplay over narrative, Monster Hunter World offers an engaging storyline that enhances the overall experience. It provides a sense of purpose and progression, driving you forward as you uncover the mysteries of the New World.

7. Accessibility and Depth
Monster Hunter World strikes a perfect balance between being accessible to newcomers and offering depth for series veterans. The game includes tutorials and resources to help new players get started while maintaining the complexity and richness that long-time fans appreciate.

In summary, Monster Hunter World is a must-play for anyone who loves action-packed adventures, beautifully crafted worlds, and the thrill of the hunt. It’s a game that provides countless hours of excitement, whether you’re playing solo or with friends.

76561199027475786,179224876,"The game is enjoyable overall—you hunt monsters, complete quests with friends, and farm materials for your next armor or weapon build. However, there are a few aspects I didn’t enjoy. Firstly, the story is quite linear; it’s just okay and doesn’t offer much depth. Secondly, the stuns in this game are ggwp long—you could probably take a shit while waiting to recover. Farming materials feels like an infinite loop, and while it’s rewarding, it can get repetitive and overwhelming over time.

That said, there’s plenty to love. The boss and monster designs are fantastic, with a lot of creativity behind them. The weapon combos and designs are impressive, and the armor sets are super drippy. I’ve had a lot of fun playing with friends, especially during hunts like Zorah. HAHA

76561198112596020,179218442,"It is my time to enter Monster Hunter for the first time and here is where my experience began.

Monster Hunter World is a fun and large game that in my opinion suffers from terrible UI, terrible tutorials, convoluted maps, convoluted hub world, extremely slow movement and climbing climbing climbing, as well as very annoying repetitive systems of tracking monsters down that feels less like hunting the monster and more running around like a chicken with your head cut off searching for the farts of the monster so you can sniff it and then follow its trail to a pile of shit and then follow its trail to some mucus, which then brings you to the monster. Considering if you know the knowledge of the monsters location (which is always in the same place) you can simply go to it. 

To cut to the chase though I stopped playing this game 12 hours in and went over to Rise, which I significantly loved more which makes it hard for me to come back to this game but I definitely eventually will. Rise fixed every annoyance and peeve I had about this game, faster movement, faster climbing, no convoluted hub world that's easy to get around and do what you want to do, no convoluted maps, and generally expanded upon systems. Most importantly, no annoyingly repetitive tracking system that felt like such a chore to go through. I've seen many agree that no tracking is great in Rise, as they also found it time consuming and not fun, generally annoying. I've seen others argue its kinda what makes Monster HUNTER the game. I disagree, though tracking monsters or animals does make a major role in the concept of hunting, it needs to be done way better so I hope if it returns they create a much more fun and interesting system in Wilds which I know nothing about. Otherwise, its for the best that its completely absent in Rise. LETS GET TO THE FIGHT ALREADY!!!

My biggest issue is how this game might be recommended as a start to players new to the series like myself, many have but I find its introduction to be overwhelming and terribly explained, often also throwing walls of text at you. It is done far better in Rise and after just about a few hours of introduction in Rise I felt like I could come back to this game and understand things far more which I allso think speaks volumes to how much better Rise would be as someones first game in the series.

8.6/10 - Overall World is a solid experience, but I await my time for when I will finally get to the actual fight among other annoyances that gave me a headache.",True,728,728,1731834590,1731834590,1,0

I can’t recommend it enough and think everyone should try it.

This game truly had a vision in mind and executed it near perfectly. The bosses are fun and engaging whilst being immensely creatively designed, the weapons are fun to use with a learning curve to them and finding what works best for you it’s satisfying.

My main complains is multiplayer feeling really clunky to use and the DLC.

Iceborne (For a solo player) just felt unnecessarily difficult and I lost interest pretty quick.

76561198274117850,179175103,"At first, this game had its moments, and I had a fun time with it. However, after a while, it became extremely boring, repetitive, and tedious. While the thrill of tracking and taking down new monsters is undeniably exciting at first, the repetitive nature of the gameplay quickly drains that excitement. Each monster is designed with incredible detail, from their unique appearances to their attack patterns and behavior. However, once the initial awe wears off, the grind-heavy gameplay starts to feel monotonous and unfulfilling.

The core gameplay loop revolves around hunting monsters, crafting gear, and upgrading your equipment. For fans of grind-heavy experiences, this might sound appealing, but for anyone else, it quickly becomes tedious. Missions blur together, as they all boil down to the same objective: hunt another monster. Playing solo amplifies the monotony, as battles with monsters often drag on due to their massive health pools. While some encounters provide a decent challenge, most feel more like endurance tests rather than exercises in actual skill.

Combat is functional but flawed. It attempts to blend hack-and-slash mechanics with Souls-like elements, requiring precise timing for attacks and dodges. However, the lack of a lock-on system feels clunky and takes some getting used to. The variety of weapons is a highlight, offering unique playstyles, but even that novelty doesn’t sustain the gameplay for long.

Monster design is undeniably the game’s strongest aspect. Each creature feels alive, with fluid animations, realistic behavior, and a sense of presence that’s hard to match. Seeing monsters interact with the environment or battle each other is genuinely impressive.

The visuals, however, are inconsistent. While the environments are vibrant and full of life, textures lack detail, lighting and shadows often feel off, and the anti-aliasing blurs the image. The game also struggles with distant objects and animations dropping in framerate, further breaking immersion. Lip-syncing during cutscenes is atrocious, making the already weak story even harder to care about.

Speaking of the story—it’s barely worth mentioning. It’s a forgettable, cringe-worthy excuse to set up monster hunts, with dialogue that often borders on nonsensical. The cutscenes are equally unremarkable—long, dull, and completely skippable.

Some missions are outright poorly designed. Gathering items like mushrooms, honey, or eggs, or killing small creatures such as insects or wildlife, is mind-numbingly boring and unrewarding. Even the main missions aren’t spared. The Zorah Magdaros encounter, for example, is tedious, uninspired, and ultimately feels like filler. It’s a glaring example of how the game struggles to provide engaging content beyond its core hunting mechanics.

After like 50 hours with the game, the flaws became impossible to ignore. The grind, which was initially addictive, became exhausting. Every quest is essentially the same: hunt the same monsters, gather loot, craft gear, and repeat. By the time I had my ideal weapon and armor, I realized there was no compelling reason to continue. The game offers nothing to alleviate the repetitive cycle, and once the novelty of hunting monsters fades, so does the game’s appeal.

Ultimately, Monster Hunter World thrives on its grind and the thrill of the hunt. If that doesn’t appeal to you, this game will quickly lose its charm. While the monster designs and environments are impressive, the repetitive gameplay, lackluster story, and uninspired mission design overshadow its strengths. For me, it became uninteresting and ultimately super boring.",False,34176,12909,1731786022,1732513980,1,0

76561198005364853,179078112,"They ought to call this game [b] Monster Hunter: Running [/b] since most of the time you're running around chasing monsters than actually fighting them. The game was pretty fun early on, but now when taking 7 star quests for some reason ALL the flying monsters (Rathalos, Rathian, Legiana, etc.) won't stay in a fight for more than a few (3 - 5) minutes before flying to the other side of the map; forcing you to waste even more time and do more laps around the same areas to catch up to them. And when they do fly away, you have even less time to reach them before the fly away again; forcing you to recommence the search process. So 3/4 of the hunts will include chasing the monster down, and 1/4 involves actually fighting.

That shit gets repetitive and stale REAL fast. What makes it worse is the moment they do fly away you're now at the mercy of the game's [b] A B Y S M A L [/b] guiding system.

I must say that I still love MHW even now, I've been playing Monster Hunter since the PSP era, and when MHW was first released in 2018, to be honest, I was a bit uncomfortable at first, after all, Capcom was innovating the IP in all aspects with Triple-A standards, so I felt a bit unfamiliar with it.
But with more and more in-depth play of the game, I really feel that MHW has brought every player an unexpected surprise in very many ways, both new and old players. There are a lot of innovative settings and elements that really make the game fun and immersive. 
Monster Hunter Wilds was beta tested a couple of times ago, and I can see that there is a lot of MHW in it. It is clear that Capcom is also aware of the far-reaching impact of MHW on the series, as well as the depth of the players' passionate love for MHW. By the way, MHR feels more like a return to the traditional handheld console era to me, and while the combat is exciting, it loses a lot of the great settings that MHW shaped, like the rich ecosystem.
All in all, I would consider MHW as a rather significant Capcom gaming milestone, really, really good.",True,30248,26590,1731681341,1731681341,0,0

[h1]Graphics & Animation[/h1]
The animations and controls in MHW feel much smoother and more fluid. From hunter movements to monster behaviors, everything feels more realistic and responsive. This game truly captures the feeling of hunting monsters with incredible animation and stunning detail.

[h1]A More Impactful Story[/h1]
Unlike the older Monster Hunter games that were focused purely on gameplay, MHW brings a story that feels deeper and more connected to the world. The Monster Hunter universe feels alive, with a richer atmosphere and lore that pull you in even further.

[h1]Gameplay & Innovations[/h1]
I’ve logged [b]1,195 hours[/b] of gameplay on Steam (yep, I’m hooked and just can’t stop!). I’ve been playing since [u]day one release[/u], and I even pre-ordered it because of the hype. MHW introduces a lot of innovations, like seamless, loading-free maps, the slinger mechanic, and the ability to use the environment to fight monsters. Every gameplay element feels more seamless and natural, making the hunting experience truly satisfying.

[h1]Quality of Life Improvements[/h1]
There are so many quality-of-life features that make the game easier and more enjoyable. From smoother item management to clearer monster information and fast travel to camps, these improvements are a huge help, especially for veterans who are used to the more rigid systems in previous games.

[h1]Final Thoughts[/h1]
I have no hesitation in saying that Monster Hunter: World is one of the best Monster Hunter games ever made. With all the improvements and innovations, I’ve happily played for thousands of hours. If you haven’t played it yet, now’s the perfect time to jump into the Monster Hunter universe.

Biggest offender of this may be the ""When the Mist Taketh You"" quest in Iceborne, where you are more often than not fighting a Shrieking Legiana, and a normal Legiana.

Shrieking Legiana alone is very annoying due to iceblight and the infinite amount of shrieks he does, he may as well be an Ice Khezu.


Update(Pre-Fatalis/AT Velkhana)
With more hours into this game(~200hrs at the time of this update), it feels like I've gotten more of a grasp into this game, while my original recommendation still stands, I do feel that some aspects of this game's world that is commonly praised also have a downside to them, mostly to do with the locales within the game. 

The ancient forest is a pretty big locale that I think some may find annoying because of how twisted the paths in it can be, but my main gripe with this map has to do with the sheer amount of foliage in this game(and ledges, which I'll get to later). While it does help to build upon the grandeur of the map, helping it live up to its namesake when it comes to exploration, I think this may be the single biggest downside of the map if you ever have to actually fight something here. More often than not, you're likely to find that your camera has been obstructed by the foliage when dancing around with monsters in battle, which may or may not get you carted depending on your luck.

Another point regarding the local ecology, which encompasses all locales, are the small monsters that reside in these regions. More often than not, they end up being a hindrance to the flow of the battle(and in some cases, with monsters like Girros, will straight up get you killed), smaller monsters may obstruct your view on occasion(flying monsters in the Elder's Recess is a prime example), whilst large monsters could straight up push you away or block your attack. For a game often praised for its ability to make the in-game world feel real, it does feel like they missed the point with making these monsters stick around while you are busy fighting a monster that could kill them with a stray attack.

Lastly, ledges. I cannot put it into words how much of a double-edged sword ledges are, offensively they are a great addition for some weapons(from what I've heard, I play bow, but melees seem to benefit from them), while on other ocacsions, they will quite literally get you killed. God forbid you accidentally dodge and sprint onto a ledge, causing you to jump off/climb up, getting you killed at a moment that should've been a few seconds of reprise due to a well timed dodge.

In hindsight, this game deserves the flowers it has been showered with, the praises sung for it can easily be witnessed when you play the game(no matter if you have just started, or are a seasoned veteran). But I do feel that some aspects do get stale over time. Having to obtain the tracks for monsters to identify their location does highlight the ""hunt"" pat of ""Monster Hunter"" but after a while, you will recognize that most monsters have a few areas in which they will show-up. Legiana in the coral highlands feels like they are guaranteed to spawn in the same 3 areas, Diablos more often than not is in the sandy areas of the Wildspire Waste, whereas some monsters like Rathalos may force your hand as they are more likely to roam around a large portion of the map.

In conclusion, Monster Hunter is a great game, the grounded and slower-paced combat fits well with the attempts to make the world feel realistic(much to my dismay in some heated moments), it definitely has a great gameplay loop when it comes to hunting monsters(well msot monsters) to grind. Even if I feel like there are some questionable choices for the endgame bosses, the game still feels rewarding when you manage to nail down aspects of certain fights, such as learning and punishing movesets.

Although, if you prefer faster-paced ""Arcadey"" combat, MH Rise definitely feels like a better option, despite its watered down graphics(thanks to the Switch being a potato), I personally think the endgame bosses(Risen Elders and such) are a very fun experience once you get used to them. Although, base Rise may feel like a slog to get through, Sunbreak is definitely a top-tier experience.(Ibushi, Narwa, and Amatsu are definitely one of the elder dragons of all time :))",True,13788,11981,1731499330,1733632280,0,1

It has such a beautiful world, amazing scenery, great looking visuals with some badass looking monsters and an indepth collecting and crafting system that makes you feel like anything gives you progress... only for the movement and combat to be the most clunky and frustrating thing to have to deal with. It's baffling that your character is even able to kill a fly with how pathetic they are. I am fine with monsters dealing a lot of damage and having a lot of health, they are 10x the size of you after all, but MY GOD they attack faster than I can blink. Some monsters literally curl up into a ball and spin around all over the place and does instant 180's back at you while your character is still trying to stand up and recover from just simply dodging. It's like I am trying to control a defiant baby that just learnt to walk while fighting huge monsters that can eat me up in one bite. The amount of times I've wanted to throw my controller into the wall just because my character gets hit ONCE only to sloooooowly stand back up, look around, sneeze a few times and THEN I am finally able to control the character again. If this happens on a hard monster so are you dead, even with a food buff and max health. Doesn't matter.

One of the best action rpg co-op games from 2018.
Got lucky enough to play the psn beta and was blown away.
Proceeded to pour a forgotten amount of hundreds of hours in full release and expansion.

From the simple details of the new ecosystems to the density of flora and fauna between seamless zones and paths with zero in-map load times in contrast to the previous titles in the series. 
We were getting spoiled.

The movement system will feel a bit arcade and buttery for some, but you'll have a pick of 14 weapon classes that you can get creative with and come up with your own combo strings and technique.
There's a lot of fun and failure in the absurdity of your movement. 
Invest in stun resistances and ear plugs, you'll be unstoppable.

Story is more on the bare side and directly serves the mechanics of the co-op game.
But if you're a nerd like me who enjoys the obscure mistranslation corrections of old lore,
There are quite of few fun implications to be made if you're willing to see the ending and expansion through.
Not to mention having to engage in some of and THE best dragon super bosses in gaming in my opinion.

I didn't even know what the Monster Hunder franchise was about, so I gave it a shot with this one and holy moly, it sucked me in like no other game ever has. It's fun, it's grindy (but not annoyingly so), the environment and atmosphere are so nice and enjoyable (the Astera twilight summer festival theme will forever be one of my favorite game themes). After a while you feel like you need to research quite a bit before hunting specific monsters, so you turn to the online community and resources and there is an ocean of stuff that helps you every step of the way (weapon guides, monster guides, etc.) which makes you feel part of a huge community.

You just feel like you are an hunter on an adventure and you just want more and more. Ah, and the food looks hella delicious.

You also get to make your own weapons and armor from the things you collect, which makes your character look cooler and stronger.

76561199404408697,178580003,"Beautiful game, amazing character customization, great story, and fantastic action.

Unlike many new games coming out today, this game never feels boring or repetitive. The experience evolves alongside your character, keeping you engaged and on the move, while also letting you relax in-game whenever you need a breather. You never feel lost or confused about objectives, and the tasks aren't impossible to complete. If you struggle with a monster or can’t finish a quest, it’s easy to understand why. You’re not left feeling defeated; instead, you can easily tell if you’re not at the right level yet, and you know what steps you need to take to get there.

The game gives you full control over how you progress your character at every step, from choosing weapons to adding armor decorations that boost your stats. You can mix and match armor to your liking, even customizing colors to suit your style. Nothing in this game forces you into a specific path, which is fantastic. The events are also super fun and creative, and you’re never pressured to participate if you don’t want to.

You even get daily rewards just for logging in, and quest rewards match your rank and the quest’s difficulty. So, when you finish a tough boss fight, you’re not just left with basic items — the rewards are worthy of the challenge, making each victory feel meaningful.

Overall, this is simply a great game. I’ll always love it and keep coming back to it.",True,5635,5430,1731011509,1731011509,0,0

76561198344874942,178489689,"*Review aimed for those who have never played MH games before since vets should already know what this game is like.


MHWorld is a great option for those who have never actually played any Monhun games before to start out from, and if you found yourself interested you can even get the Iceborne expansion(in fact you SHOULD because it pretty much triples the content). As per usual, wait for discount since full price is pricey af.


The early game can be a slog and getting used to weapons will take a while, controller is highly recommended though still doable with KBM. The gameplay loop is basically just: find monster>hunt monster>repeat, it can get repetitive and mundane at times, having to chase stuff around the map for like 20+ minutes, so it's definitely not for everyone.


But is it fun? Hell fucking yeah it is, even better if you can find 3 other friends to goof around with; you go in, find big monster, and you whack the big monsters with big weapons, while everything else is just there to make you whack the monster harder, the end. Simple, but sometimes simple stuff are also the most fun stuff.


Tl;dr its a fun action game where you go in and, well, hunt monsters. Don't worry too much about story its just there as an excuse to make the cool monsters appear. If you're checking this game out because of MHWilds, do definitely give this a shot.",True,15393,14862,1730882208,1730882208,0,0

Not one other game out there that makes you actually feel like a real hunter.  Gameplay is just nuts. In the beginning it felt a bit clunky, even for a souls die-hard like me. But I guess that's normal. 
Gameplay loop is really insane and you're just happy about every tiny thing you find, loot, extract or catch.
On top, everything has a real and useful purpose to it. That's really rare.

Just 14h in but until now it's definitely a 10/10. And that's rare. Last 10/10s I can remember are BG3 and ER. Then there is a big Gap until Witcher 3. Not even RDR2 was one for me.
So glad I finally enjoy it more than I've ever thought.

Monster Hunter: World is easily my favorite game for a few different reasons, and by far one of the [i]best[/i] Monster Hunter games in the series and the easiest game to get into if you're curious about the series. 

The weapons as a whole are fantastic, they all have wonderful weight to them, you can feel each hit and the delay between certain moves makes them feel even more realistic and sometimes even more fluid! Certain weapons are certainly less fun than others, personally, but all of them have their own merit and its just fantastic as a whole! The character customization is shockingly good imo, you might not have as much freedom as some more ""modern"" games but its still [i]good[/i]!

Then there's the world itself, the story, and monster ecology! Its fantastic. The story flows incredibly well, and the game does a really good job of easing you into the difficulty and giving you a steady progression of harder and harder monsters to fight until you get a good handle on things! The training room is honestly a really useful resource as well, though I do feel its underutilized by many people since the game really only mentions its existence once or twice. The monsters have absolutely fantastic designs, which generally make sense especially once you look into their ecology, there are a couple odd designs but none of them feel too jarring to the point where they don't fit. 

The expansion, Iceborne, especially has a really fantastically paced story (though it can be pretty difficult if you're not comfortable with the expansion's combat gimmick, which is probably one of my only major complaints with IB).

On the whole I think World is a absolutely brilliant game and a really wonderful introduction to Monster Hunter [strike]and a game with so much stay power I worry Capcom may never be able to top it lol[/strike]",True,91130,82136,1730817665,1730817665,0,0

Sometimes it can feel slow, sometimes it can feel frustrating. But around that there's so much to love about what goes into planning for hunts, getting the right equipment, and just being out there in the field against so many awesome monsters. 

It's a very good introduction to the series if you're willing to get through the beginning parts. I feel as if the first few hours are definitely the slowest parts and initially turned me away years ago, but once you're past that, it just keeps getting better and better--especially when you reach Master Rank, as that is when many people agree that the game really gets great. And it is, the difficulty ramps up and you can really feel like every hunt is its own, unique challenge. 

Definitely a game that I would recommend for anyone who loves worlds like these filled with a variety of monsters and great ways to combat them. Each of the 14 weapon types all feel like they have real weight to them and there are so many times where a good hit will just feel so satisfying. All in all, just play it.

[b]Today, January 20th, 2025, I finally obtained all the trophies in this beautiful game.[/b]  
It has been an [i]amazing journey,[/i] full of joy, excitement, anger, frustration, but above all, [b]love.[/b]  

[h2]Love…[/h2]  
That word perfectly describes this game. The love the developers poured into it makes the game shine as brightly as [b]Tzitzi-Ya Ku's flash.[/b]  

The monsters are as [i]wonderful[/i] as they are complex, the zones, the weather, the ecosystem—[u]LIFE[/u]—it all feels [b]ALIVE.[/b]  
The wide variety of weapons lets you choose and enjoy the game in the way you feel most comfortable, without ever losing its challenge.  

If the soundtrack were water and the situation a glass, the water would balance perfectly at the rim of the glass—[i]it's simply flawless.[/i]  

[h3]If you're reading this...[/h3]  
No matter what year it is, if you can, [b]play it.[/b] You'll love it.  
And when you feel stuck, there will always be a hunter willing to help and teach you. And one day, when you feel like there's nothing left to do (though that'll take a long time), you'll find yourself doing the same for others.

I sank over 250 hours into this title and for good reason. The improvements from the previous Monster Hunter Titles are stunning. Both newcommers and Veterans have their place here. If you have tried previous Titles and are hesitant to try this one: You have no reason to worry. 

And even if you missed the main Hypetrain: This is still a game worth your money, with a playerbase that still hunts everything from timed event boss raids, to the final Boss of the Expansion.

The monsters are incredible, though. Every one of them is like a boss fight with an attitude. I’ve lost count of how many times I thought I was doing great, only to get flattened by a T-Rex with anger issues. And let’s talk about Palicoes — these little cats are the real heroes. I’m out here flailing around, and my Palico is actually doing damage and healing me. Bless their tiny warrior hearts.

The crafting system is... intense. You want that sweet new armor set? Great, all you need is 37 rare materials, a little luck, and the patience of a saint. Cue the endless cycle of hunting the same monster just so I can get that one drop that never, ever seems to show up.

_Nota:_ 9.5/10

_Resumo:_

""Monster Hunter: World"" é um desafio épico que te coloca face a face com monstros lendários. Mas há um que se destaca como o verdadeiro rei do caos: o Brachydios Colérico.

_Pontos positivos:_

- O Brachydios Colérico é o verdadeiro teste de sanidade (e habilidade)
- Armas e armaduras para personalizar sua estratégia
- Ambiente dinâmico e cheio de surpresas
- Multiplayer: porque enfrentar o Brachydios sozinho é suicídio

_Pontos negativos:_

- O Brachydios Colérico é mais difícil que o Fatalis (sim, é possível)
- Você vai morrer. Muito. Muito mesmo.
- Você vai precisar de uma terapia intensiva após enfrentar o Brachydios

*Monster Hunter: World* is no mere game; it’s an epic crusade into a realm of monstrous behemoths and ancient beasts that demands the might of a true warrior. The New World is wild, unforgiving, and teeming with prey that will test your skill, your grit, and your very soul. And I, Deathbringer, will tell you: this hunt is nothing short of legendary.

Each creature is a towering challenge, a fierce opponent that turns every fight into a battle of survival. These beasts don’t fall easily—they are cunning, powerful, and relentless. Each hunt feels like entering the arena of legends. The thrill of facing down the mighty Rathalos or the thunderous Nergigante is a call to arms that shakes the ground and brings out the hunter in your soul. Here, you must learn to read your enemy, anticipate every attack, every roar, every movement, and strike when the moment is right. 

You forge your own armor from the remains of those you've bested, each piece a testament to your grit and victories, a blood-soaked badge of honor. Your weapon is no mere tool—it’s a companion, a relentless reaper forged in the fires of war, and in your hands, it becomes a weapon of legend. Whether you wield a massive Great Sword, a Bow, or a savage Dual Blade, each strike is thunderous, each battle unforgettable.

This is the call of *Monster Hunter: World*: enter the wild, sharpen your steel, and let every beast that roams this untamed world know your name hunter. This is not just a hunt—it’s a trial by fire, a journey that will push you to your limits and carve your name into legend. Victory is sweet, but here, it’s earned with blood, sweat, and the roar of triumph that echoes across the New World!

I recently got it on PC in preparation for Wilds which I will be playing on PC, and I wanted to get familiar with controls and systems on PC. WITH THAT SAID: 

Honestly, if you're even remotely interested in hunting massive, terrifying, beautifully designed monsters, Monster Hunter World is a must-play. Capcom has completely outdone themselves here, creating a world that’s alive and just begging to be explored. The environments are incredible—you’ve got lush forests, eerie deserts, coral highlands that look like something from a dream—all packed with creatures that behave like real animals with their own habits, territories, and rivalries.

The Hunting Gameplay 🎯💥
At its core, this game is all about hunting big, mean monsters. And boy, does it nail that. You’ve got 14 different weapons to choose from, and they all feel unique. Whether you're going in heavy with a massive sword or getting tactical with a bowgun, there’s something here for every type of player. And it’s not about button-mashing either—you have to learn each monster’s patterns, dodge at the right times, and really work for those hits. When you finally take down a giant Anjanath after a 20-minute battle, it feels ridiculously satisfying.
The game doesn't do a lot of hand-holding, and I love that. You get better not by grinding levels but by actually getting good at the game—learning when to dodge, when to attack, and where each monster’s weak spots are. It's a steep learning curve, but once you’re over the hump, it’s incredibly rewarding.

Multiplayer Makes It Even Better 💪
If you’re thinking of playing with friends, Monster Hunter World makes it easy to dive into co-op battles. Just fire off an SOS flare, and other players can jump in to help. It’s awesome for those tougher fights when a helping hand (or sword, or bow) really comes in handy. Plus, there’s a whole community vibe here—everyone wants to help out, take down monsters together, and share tips for the best gear and strategies. The multiplayer is where some of the best memories are made, especially when you’re in a tight spot and your team pulls off a last-minute save.
The Loot and Customization 🛠️👕
This game nails that perfect loot loop: every monster you hunt gives you parts to make awesome weapons and armor inspired by that creature’s look and abilities. You end up with these epic sets that make you look like a total badass, plus each piece of gear has skills that you can mix and match to create your perfect setup. Trust me, if you’re the kind of person who loves tweaking gear for that perfect build, this game will eat up hours of your life in the best way.

TL;DR – Get It. Play It. Love It. ❤️
Monster Hunter World is hands down one of the best games I’ve ever played. It’s got depth, a ton of heart, and it’s just plain fun. The monsters are fierce, the world is beautiful, and the feeling of taking down your first Elder Dragon? Unmatched. If you’re looking for an action RPG that’ll keep you hooked for hours, look no further.

76561198814546883,177945764,"[h1] ""Spending time with your cat! and I guess hunting monsters."" [/h1]

is my first game in the franchise. I always heard that it was a franchise known for grind like crazy without a job, but that this game was the exception, and that's true. Out of the approximately 50 hours it took me to finish the game, I only grinded one monster because not all my weapons were effective against the fire kitty. Taking this context into account, let's begin with the not-so-serious review that arrives about 6 years late!

Graphics and Aesthetics
Visuals: For a game from 2018, it looks pretty good. There are contemporary games with better visuals, but Monster Hunter World holds its own, and in my opinion, it has aged well. You won't see the pores on the handler, but it looks good.
Art Style: The art style is very immersive and distinctive, giving the game its own unique personality.

Gameplay
Hunting Mechanics: You feel like a true hunter, stalking and utilizing your environment to track and slay any monster that dares to look at you the wrong way. However, you always feel the threat posed by many species of monsters (especially towards the end), like the bomber plane with legs that ruined more than one of my hunts.
Multiplayer: Honestly, I never used it because I prefer enjoying these types of games solo. But I had to mention it because it exists, although I have no idea how active it still is. I only shot off a multiplayer flare once in the entire game to get an achievement, but no one showed up ☹

Story 
Narrative: A story that could be described as 'linear,' but it's quite engaging. I appreciate how the New World (the continent) itself is part of the narrative. Nothing from the OTHER WORLD (get it? hehe), but it gets the job done.
Open World: You can go on expeditions without specific objectives, just to explore and hunt anything that moves without time limits. It's quite fun and immersive just to enjoy the environment and the wild battles that turn a peaceful stroll into a race for your life if you weren't well-equipped (that pickle gave me a scare the first time it attacked).

Progression and Gameplay Loop
Progression System: Here comes the finely tuned gameplay loop of this gaming masterpiece. Pay attention: kill monsters to get/improve weapons and armor to kill stronger monsters and obtain even stronger weapons and armor to hunt even stronger monsters... I think you get the idea. It's incredible how addictive and well-crafted this system is.
Rewards: If it wasn't clear from the previous point that I'm a fake human... well, there are many more rewards to talk about, like jewels, but it's better for everyone to discover those on their own.

Challenges and Difficulties
Difficulty Level: A progressively challenging curve that's quite accessible to anyone. There are certain monsters that present a sudden spike in difficulty (still traumatized by Nergigante), but overall, the hunts are challenging yet fair, making you feel that if you fail, it's because you didn't prepare well enough or because your cat has better reflexes than you (or maybe that's just me).
PDF Tutorials: I didn't know what to call this point, but I mention it just to say that the tutorials seem designed to disrupt the gameplay rhythm, as some overload you with information even for the most basic things. It can be a bit annoying at first, but it's a minor inconvenience to survive to enjoy this amazing game.

Sound and Music
Soundtrack: Very memorable and immersive. Just listen to the theme of my nightmare generator, Nergigante.
Sound Effects: Equally good as the previous point, although not mandatory, it's recommended to play with headphones.

Conclusion
One of the best games I've played this year; it's absolutely worth it!
P.S.: Anyone who doesn't take their cat on adventures deserves jail time. The cat is the most important; monster hunting is secondary.

Rating: 9/10 - you can't pet your cat""",True,2902,2902,1730159608,1730159608,127,13

Large variety in monsters, beautiful locations that feel alive, and the weapon moves are all balanced pretty well. World and Iceborne are solid entries that are a perfect way to drop into the series if you are interested in the games or Wilds. Some small issues with the game include a lack of any build variety in endgame, the clutch claw and tenderize mechanic feeling intrusive in combat, and the difficulties playing with a friend on their way through because of the cutscene shenangins. If you are tempted to play the game, SOS flares allow you to call in help, or join in on a hunt if you want to play with people but don't want to enter a lobby.

76561198452302080,177822845,"Game is great, grinding is terrible, completely garbage. Forced cutscenes and progression to illude players into thinking the game is longer than it should be (it took me 40 hours to beat the game, and it was already being a fucking repetition fest by that point), and it also means new monsters introduced, specially in Iceborn, cannot be prepared for in advance because they are introduced on a whim. You just have to hope you have a good gear to fight that monster, or waste time by redoing your entire gear set (after abandoning the mission, if you want to be more precise), or if you want to waste not too much time, do it in camp, and hope the monster doesn't run away.

Its not that bad after you push through the bad parts and get good gear, it just becomes a boss rush trainer with RPG elements. You have to get used to be bullied by the game's design before you can fully enjoy it. If you can, you'll have fun for a good while.

Its not a good game to get into, it is a great game to be addicted to. Do with that as you wish. And crucify capcom for making stupid and bad DLCs that should be part of the base game.",False,5613,4057,1730000626,1730000626,0,1

The shield axe poked out a small half of the shield face from one side of the backpack and stared at me with its smooth shield face for a while, then retracted and let out a faint sigh that was almost inaudible.
You're talking nonsense again, ""Miss Shield Axe said.
I truly feel that way, ""I told her. Because the cuteness of the shield axe has reached the level of the former Ape God and the latter King Ice Mira
Miss Shield Axe didn't respond, her broad hooked blade shield covered her petite sword blade. However, crossing over the shiny shield, I saw her six charging bottles swaying gently, as if a deer was lightly crossing a spring stream.
After a while, the shield axe poked its head out again.
Do you really think so? I'm cute or something
Her cheeks were slightly flushed.
It's absolutely true, I swear
This time, Miss Shield Axe quickly retracted her axe blade, and the little deer bounced even more joyfully.
If it's a gymnastics girl, should we call her Tai Dao? ""She sounded in a good mood, playing with the transformation mechanism while chatting with me. But I decided to make a bad one.
No, it's called the perfect weapon
Who is the perfect weapon
It's another weapon, ""I pretended to admire the scenery."" She's full of kindness, hardworking and tolerant, very cute, always wanting to bring happiness to others, and can quickly enter a fighting state. Everyone likes her
Is it better than a film player
Better than a film player
But you clearly said before
The taste of chopping and charging disappeared together. Miss Shield Axe stood up and stared at me as if she was confirming something, facing my pretended serious face. Finally, she lowered her head and looked away with a hint of anger, muttering softly in her mouth.
I was ready to receive a high output attribute liberation slash, but the shield axe took three steps and two steps to nest in the tent, and opened the red shield and red sword on its own. I gently walked to the chair, half kneeling, but she turned her face away.
Scammers, ""she said.
The blade of the chainsaw was spinning, and my heart was pounding. The gentle breeze that used to be blown by the steel dragon fan inappropriately blew into the camp tent of the Dragon Crystal Land, blowing away her carefully decorated charging bottle preparation device, messing up her silky axe blade lines, and dispersing my thoughts. I want to tell her, tell this silly girl, she's the one
But like a prophet, the shield axe turned around and lightly pressed the red sword against my mouth.
She is smiling, like a crescent moon, a faint smile that I will never forget in the years to come. It's broken, she knows everything.
Years later, occasionally looking back on that afternoon, I feel a bit lost. If I could start over, would I have a chance to tell Miss Dun Axe? It was just a simple, rustic sentence.

76561198127633211,177679797,"Monster Hunter: World : By Triple F

""Monster Hunter: World"", released in January 2018 by Capcom, revolutionizes the iconic franchise, bringing its core mechanics to a wider audience while retaining the depth and complexity that fans cherish. Set in the lush environments of the New World, players step into the role of a hunter tasked with uncovering the mysteries of this uncharted territory, populated by awe-inspiring monsters. This installment serves as a perfect entry point for newcomers, offering streamlined systems and rich, immersive gameplay that captivates both veterans and those new to the series.

At the heart of ""Monster Hunter: World"" lies its dynamic combat system, which beautifully blends strategic planning with fast-paced action. The game features a diverse array of weapon classes, each with unique play-styles, combos, and mechanics. From the heavy-hitting Great Sword to the agile Dual Blades, players can choose a weapon that suits their preferences, encouraging experimentation and mastery. The introduction of movement mechanics, such as climbing and gliding, enhances combat and exploration, allowing hunters to navigate the environment more fluidly during battles. The ability to track and trap monsters using various tools adds layers of strategy to each hunt, making encounters feel both exhilarating and rewarding.

The world design in ""Monster Hunter: World"" is a significant step forward for the series. The game presents a seamless open-world environment, where players can traverse interconnected ecosystems filled with diverse flora and fauna. The environments are richly detailed, ranging from the dense jungles of Ancient Forest to the arid landscapes of the Wildspire Waste, each home to its unique set of monsters and challenges. The ambient sounds and dynamic weather further enhance immersion, creating a living world that feels vibrant and alive. The return of the resource-gathering and crafting systems allows players to gather materials from the environment, encouraging exploration and rewarding curiosity.

One of the standout features of ""Monster Hunter: World"" is its emphasis on cooperative multiplayer gameplay. Up to four players can team up for hunts, with the option for seamless matchmaking through online play. This encourages collaboration, as players must communicate and coordinate their strategies to tackle larger and more challenging monsters. The game’s robust quest system makes it easy to join friends or find new hunting partners, fostering a sense of community among players. Additionally, the introduction of the SOS Flare allows players to call for assistance during difficult hunts, reducing frustration and ensuring that help is readily available when needed.

The monster roster in ""Monster Hunter: World"" is also quite impressive, featuring both returning favorites and new creatures that showcase Capcom's creativity. Iconic monsters like Rathalos and Deviljho are complemented by innovative designs such as Nergigante, a formidable beast that epitomizes the game’s design philosophy. Each monster has unique behaviors, weaknesses, and ecological interactions, making every hunt feel distinct and dynamic. The ecological system allows players to witness interactions between different monsters, adding depth to the world and encouraging players to observe rather than simply engage. This complexity elevates the hunting experience, as players must adapt their strategies based on their knowledge of the monsters’ habits.

The narrative in ""Monster Hunter: World"" serves as a backdrop for the action, centering around the Fifth Fleet’s expedition to the New World. Players uncover the mysteries of Elder Dragons and the ecosystem, all while interacting with a cast of colorful characters, including the charming handler and the enigmatic Research Commission. While the story may not be the primary focus, it provides context and purpose for the hunts, allowing players to feel invested in the world and its inhabitants. The lore is fleshed out through optional investigations and conversations, rewarding players who seek to delve deeper into the game’s rich narrative tapestry.

All in all, ""Monster Hunter: World"" successfully revitalizes the franchise by blending traditional gameplay elements with innovative design and accessibility. Its dynamic combat, expansive open-world environments, and emphasis on cooperative play create an engaging experience that caters to both newcomers and seasoned hunters. The attention to detail in world-building and monster design reflects Capcom's commitment to delivering a captivating and immersive gaming experience. With its perfect balance of action, exploration, and camaraderie, ""Monster Hunter: World"" stands as a landmark title in the series, setting the stage for future adventures in the vast and thrilling world of monster hunting.

It's not bad, but:

I went into the game completely blind, thinking this would be a good co-op game. Turns out it's an ok game, but a BAD co-op game.


[h2]Co-op[/h2]
This was the main reason I bought this, but it turns out this is NOT a co-op game, it's an ""occasional co-op with strict limitations"" -game.

What I mean is this: [b]You can not co-op this game from start to finish with a friend playing along with you, period.[/b]

[olist]
    [*]The game has this Darksouls -like invasion mechanic, where you can summon/request ""help"" from random players in some missions at certain points. However, instead asking randoms for help, [b]this[/b] is the moment you can ask directly your co-op friend to help, and most often [b]only[/b] at these points.

    [*]Apart from the above mentioned ""co-op"" -feature, you can sometimes in rare occasions start a mission with your friend, but even then it's usually [b]only[/b] if they have already beaten the said mission previously. Yes, you've read that right, in a lot o missions, if your friend has not played the mission, as you would if you are, u know, [b]PLAYING F:ING CO-OP[/b] they can not join in, period.

    [*]On one positive note, the world loot is not shared, but individualized, so you don't need to fight over it. Also as far as I can tell, there is no friendly fire.
[/olist]

[h2]Combat[/h2]
This is going to be more of a matter of taste, but I really don't like it, and the reason is tank controls.

Now I don't mean the way that the character moves, but the way they attack. You character does not attack in the direction you are looking, but in the direction the character model is facing when you start attacking, and it will not change direction, with two exceptions: when using a sword & shield (aka the second most boring weapon in the game) or a ranged weapon (aka the most boring weapon in the game), with any other weapon, you are stuck attacking into the direction you were facing.

And the lock-on system just hinders you, because it jumps around like a flee on meth, and just makes an annoying combat, actually impossible, because it never targets the enemy closest to you.

This game also comes with a combo system, which means that unless you are doing the combos, aka multiple specific attacks in-a-row un-interrupted, not only are you doing but a fraction of the damage you should/need to be doing.

You also can not interrupt your own attacks to dodge or block. Once you start swinging, you are locked in, which means you can't react to enemies: ""it's about to charge, better dodge"", oh no no, you need to memorize their combat AI to know exactly how much time and what behavior set follows which, or you are going to get just thrown around.

The game is not particularly hard per se, but it's frustrating and annoying. I did not die once playing the game, all-though I was more then once nearly one-shot (also not cool), but the combat drove me absolutely mad, not because of any challenge, but because I did not feel like I was fighting the dinos, but my own character and the controls.

On a positive note, the game has a lot of weapons, and I tried them all, and they are all very flashy and over the top, and the animations are very pretty and smooth.


[h2]Monsters[/h2]
I don't know what I was expecting going into a game called ""the monster hunter"", but I was disappointed. 

What I mean is, that when I hear the word ""monster"", I don't think dinosaurs, and I especially don't think ""just dinosaurs, occasional giant bat, beetle and a goat-deer"". This game should have been called ""Jurassic Hunter"", or [strike] Dino Crisis [/strike] or ""Sword-Rex"" or ""Barney May Cry"".

I honestly thought the game would feature something like goblins, minotaurs, demons, undead you know, [b]monsters[/b]. This game just makes me feel bad slaughtering all the dinos going about their business. It's like playing Morrowind an only killing scribs and netches. And the worst part, you can't even tame them, no raptor mounts, shame on you Capcom.


[h2]Story[/h2]
I realize people don't play these kinds of games for their story or immersion, and I can see why, but the thing is, I do. I am the kind of person who plays e.g. Path of Exile and Diablo 2 because I enjoy the story and the world they've built.

And uh, it's... well honestly I can't tell you what exactly it is. The story of the game is, that you are a part of the 5th fleet of ""researchers"", who want to capture a kaiju monster made out of lava rocks, because.... ummm science? Now, the reason you are the 5th fleet, is because the other fleets/generations who tried it before you decided that researching was for nerds, and they turned into bunch of edgy hermits, druggies and ""I'm too kool 4 skool"" -types, and wanted to just hunt and eat dinos, I guess. So the M.O. of the 5th fleet is pretty much ""this time we [b]won't[/b] get bored out of out minds and go insane, but actually do what we were supposed to do!""

And by the gods that creature that keeps following you through out the game and just keeps annoying you and keeps getting into trouble, why, why why why did you (Capcom) think it was cute?! And no, I'm not talking about the sentient cat slave, that's fine, I'm talking about is the infamous creature known as the ""Handler"", because she apparently knows just how down right criminally annoying she is, that she won't ever tell you her name, so you can't sue her in the dino-court or commit her to a mental institution. And I swear this is not made up, but on top of it all she decided to dress up like a goddamn furry cat for like most the time I played the game, and only stopped once I'd decided I that I've had enough of this game!

So anyway, the game story is to research the dinos, and you spend the whole game just slaughtering them for their shiny bits to make shinier weapons to slaughter even more of them. I am no zoologist, but I pretty confident that that's now how it works. At least in pokemon games you mostly just capture them and interbreed them and... you know what, maybe slaughtering pokemons would be a better idea, hey, what's this Palword thing....


[h2]Systems[/h2]
I'll be honest, this game is a bit too much information -dump for anyone new to the game, and it really kind of burned me out. It's a lot like I'd imagine anyone who's never played Path of Exile would feel playing it for the first time today. Also, the crafting system seems both okay, but also ""I need 5 butt feathers from a dino that takes 10-15 minutes to kill each time, and it's not even a guaranteed drop?"" -kind of deal.

Grinding materials is fine when the combat is fun, but like I said in my combat section, it's really not, it's functional with it's very own ""special rules"". It's challenging, the same way as trying to cancel your cable is challenging, but fun it is not.


[h2]Character Creation[/h2]
This is a bit weird. Capcom has shown with DDDA that they can make a character creator with normal people, but here, what happened?

It's not horrible, but they are all, well the best way to describe them is ""tall dwarfs"". Their legs are too short, heads are too big, and I can't for the life of me produce an actual pretty female character. I have to cover her face with really colorful make up, because these ladies really hit  their face on every branch of the ugly tree the way down and then someone stole their breasts and buttocks on top of it. I mean it's not as bad as in the recent <REDACTED> or <REDACTED> and let's not forget that horrible tv show <SUPER REDACTED>, but I wonder if the real reason they doing the dino research is to find the lost X-chromosome.


[h2]TLDR[/h2]

The world is just beautiful—there’s so much detail in the environments, and the monsters look awesome. Each one feels unique, and hunting them down is super satisfying.

The combat is where this game really shines. There are so many different weapons to choose from, and each one feels totally different. I’ve spent hours just figuring out which weapon works best for me, and even then, I find myself wanting to try something new. The hunts are intense, especially when you're tracking a giant monster through these huge, open areas. It feels like a real challenge but in a fun way.

I love that you can play solo or team up with friends. Playing co-op with my buddies makes the hunts even more exciting because there’s just something about taking down a massive monster together that feels epic.

Saying, the game is trash, like nearly every Capcom-game, that depends on a network-connection for anything...either this type of game or their beat 'em ups, where you can contest against others over the internet, who just DDOS your stuff and win ""Versus""-matches this way...they lack the skill and brain, to defeat you cleanly and so they do it dirty, but the provider/developer is too stupid, to fullfill their stupid duty, of making their stuff ""unriggable"". 


In this game, you're making a distress-call, since you can't handle some of the beasts on your own, sometimes even seemingly friendly players respond and join. 

When so, you are the host and supposed to do the main-damage etc., but you can't since if you fainted too often, whole session is gone with the wind and you wasted your time and efforts, as your seemingly helper ones. 

And you can easily faint, since - like a miracle - controls, ingame-mechanisms (like potions or cooling drinks, when you're on fire) either don't get started, or the animation takes place, but the effects don't. 

A company, introducing such a stupid mechanisms in anything else but a Soulslike-game lacks severely and in many things, mainly brain and reasonability.

Capcom - rising star of the 80s/90s - only seems to be capable in one thing left...coating turd as gold, since you can't argue about the looks. 

If you get this game - or any other of its series - gifted by anyone, consider this person hates you and wants to harm you, or just is plain stupid and naive. 



My former experience was like: 
Posted 20 October, 2024. Last edited 20 October, 2024.

Bought it in a bundle with the Icebourne-DLC, installed everything (plus additional free DLCs on Steam), played through original storymode and made some sidequests/grinds along the way.


Basically a neat game, with esthatical graphics (maybe only with the texture-pack, don't recall having noticed a big difference, but also didn't watch out, before installing, because it already looked good), a bit weird mechanisms and a lo(o)t...lo(o)t..lo(o)t...lo(o)t...lo(o)t...of grinding.


Only been playing singleplayer-mode (hosting a friend-session without having any[, owning the game ;p ]), guess it's more fun and easier with others, but i wanted the story-experience independant from other influences.

Mostly negative aspects:
Quite redundant grinds over time, high costs of stuff ingame (ingredients to craft and refine stuff) and no offline-gaming possible, so permanent internet-connection required...and therefore vulnerability for cyber-attacks/remote-manipulation.

If you're willing to wield these risks (like in nearly all MMO-games), this isn't the wrong choice to make.
It also supports PS-controllers, but i preferred mouse and keyboard for more coordinated runs.


So yeah...can recommend purchase on a decent discount and adding the free DLCs so far.

Rest assured, this game is designed to abuse you until you rage quit and no amount of skill is sufficient to overcome their game design choices. Some monsters simply cannot be beaten with any given weapon l. One in particular releases undodgeable explosive slime every time you hit it meaning that melee weapons are just SOL.

76561198043880957,177373833,"When Monster Hunter World came out, I could safely say it was my favorite Monster Hunter game. Then Iceborne came out and I despised it. I absolutely hated clutch claw, as part of the gimmick is to allow hunters to 'find openings,' and 'close the gap.' Sounds great until you attempt to use the new gimmick in game. Smaller monsters typically will not give you such a hard time. Anything remotely irritating will 'read' this input and either hit you midair (full damage, full punishment) or will change what they are doing just to hit you off of them. 

Fine, lets not use the clutch claw then. Now just hunt the monster like you think you could before. You realize that everything you hit deals much less damage than before. To work around this, you are expected to 'tenderize' that 'hitzone'  with your clutch claw. So the mechanic that was implemented as a way of you being aggressive with the monster that is constantly putting you in danger is now 'necessary' to do what we were already used to.

Clutch claw legitimately made me put the game down for years. I mean YEARS. I came back recently in hopes of finishing the game and not being such a va**na about ONE mechanic. After learning the game once again, I can finally forgive the Clutch Claw. I won't forget that MH devs tried to change the pace of the game via G rank expansion, but I will forgive them.

Monster Hunter World: Iceborne truly does expand on an already great game experience, I do recommend it to anyone has thought about getting into Monster Hunter before buying Wilds.

I have solo'd Alatreon & Fatalis at this point in my 600+ hours of gameplay. I know there is plenty of online discussion about these boss fights being hard. There is no sugarcoating this: Those fights are hard. You will die. You will get mad.  You will try to look up guides on how to do these fights on Youtube. Word of the wise; Build for Health Boost and Divine Protection. You are not going to be a SpeedRunner god on your first time. Accept that these fights are designed to kick your teeth in and learn. I had to fight Fatalis 53 times. If I can struggle that much and still beat them, you can too.

76561198038834616,177356285,"This game lacks any form of quality control

yeah sure there each monster has unique mechanics, but one of those mechanics is a monster that swings his head so much you cant hit it, so the part that drops from it is so rare that you need to grind that monster over and over with no progress (my high score is 5 perfect captures in a row with no part dropped). Other monster's unique mechanic is that he has a long recovery time, but during that recovery time you stumble around likea drunk toddler because he hit the ground to hard and tremors I guess, effectively just pausing the fight for 10 seconds. Yes its spammable

Some story missions are just flat out lies, they make you belive you take part in this massive operation, but you can just put down the controller.

Some monsters are reskins of the old ones, but asa twist they decide to just skip their attack startup animation, and proceed to spam an insta poison attack that, just like many more attacks in this game, can go from Idle to hitting in 0.5 seconds. Most combat is you anticipating and not reacting now that I think about it. Yes its all learnable, but so is Elden Ring no hit run.

And many more smaller examples of weird, lazy balance and mechanics that no self respectable developer should ever put in their game.

This game at its core is fun, but there is so much random BS in it that will just frustrate You. The series just runs on the community of people that stuck to it since the time the series' idea was novel, and now they just forgive all this sloppy design because ""its better than it used to be"".

If you're patient and ready to learn, by all means give it a go, but this game is filled to the brim with pointless frustrations.",False,6555,3308,1729366835,1729366835,1,0

76561198840132958,177250400,"The game goes to elaborate lengths to really capture this feeling of being a hunter so insanely well by how elaborate and interactive the fights are by identifying, preparing, tracking and hunting down the monsters, with each one requiring different equipment and strategies. As well as the fights all taking place in a very immersive and interactive ecosystem where you'll be using everything available to you during the fights. Each fight is an extremely engaging 30 minute long adrenaline rush where every moment feels like you're just barely hanging on from the monster's attacks, as well as making you feel completely unmatched as the monster throws you around like a toy effortlessly or watching monsters clash against each other in turf wars and then having a gradual shift in tides where you take control of the fight as you break off parts of the monster, making it slowly become weaker. 

The combat and controls for this game not everyone will like and takes some getting used to it, The controls are a lot more slow and deliberate that feels stiff and clunky but in a really good way, and once it all clicks with you, you'll be hooked. The combat is extremely enjoyable and addictive once you start learning the rhythm and movesets of each fight. It's extremely well done with intricate mechanics and complexities, that is easy to get in to but also has a really high skill gap with incredible depth, with each weapon feeling like you're playing an entirely different game. 

With all of that being said, now for my criticisms, which I have a lot.

Firstly, the game loves to waste your time on purpose. From the layout of the Astera hub, unskippable cutscenes, Terrible and slow menus and UIs, tracking monsters, having to go through 5 diologues to talk to npcs, etc. In a game where you do the same thing a million times, it needs to be streamlined as much as possible.
Grinding for equipment and jewels just comes down to pure RNG where youll be fighting the same monster a dozen times for hours in hopes of getting a specific drop. It's not fun or interesting in any way in my opinion and just adds artificial time length to the game like everything else in the game that is made to waste your time. Theres a million different subsystems and garbage mechanics and items, that all add nothing of value to the game for no reason, all of which poorly executed or unneeded that all add up to make the game extremely tedious and ruin the experience in my opinion. Some examples for me being mantles, clutch claw, a million different consumables and throwables, hot/cold potions, etc.

The storyline is a joke, which wouldnt be a big deal since its not the focus of the game and not what people play for, but it often gets in the way of the gameplay for me with boring story missions you have to do.

Now for the monster fights. There is a difference, besides a skill issue, in monster difficulty that is fun to fight and annoying to fight. Majority of the monsters in this game fall under the annoying difficulty. Every single monster needs to have annoying AOE lingering status effect attacks, or one shot you because you didnt iframe a roar, terrible hitboxes, and then of course the clutch claw and tenderizing mechanic that you're pretty much forced to use to keep up with damage on later monsters. There is also a time limit on quests which I think is really cheap artificial difficulty. There are better solutions. 
Turf wars, while they are cool the first few times, just ruin the flows of fights I think and is executed poorly and doesn't make for good gameplay, and dung pods arent a solution either because it just means another niche item I have to carry around and would either just not work or have the monster come back like 2 minutes later. 
Same with tracking monsters which I think doesnt make for interesting exploration picking up tracks on the ground a million times aimlessly in a giant maze until a trail appears that takes you right to the monster, except it decides to not work half of the time. I don't care too much for an elaborate map when im spending 90% of the time fighting the monster in my opinion but others may disagree.
Also with each fight sometimes being upwards of 30-50 minutes long, how is there not a pause feature?

The game just has a different design philosophy than what im used to that not everyone will like but its the most addicted ive been to a game in a long time.
Im now 150 hours deep and still have some more post game content to do. The Guiding Lands grind is really enjoyable for me. 
Definitely worth the price, especially with Iceborne. Theres just so many weird design choices in this game that could easily be improved upon and hope they do in future titles

I’ve clocked 70 hours and finally reached the Fatalis quest. Take this review with a grain of salt, but here’s how it’s been going for me:

Story: 5/10
It’s...okay. Nothing groundbreaking—feels like a throwback to the 2000s Capcom formula. Basically, you beat a bad guy, and then an even bigger bad guy shows up. Rinse and repeat.

Graphics: 7/10
The visuals are solid, but the overuse of bloom sometimes makes everything look a bit too washed out. Like someone left the game in the sun for too long.

Monster Battles: 8/10
This is Monster Hunter, so naturally, the battles are the star of the show.

Monster Design: 3/10
Here me out, we should call this game Dragon/Wyvern Hunter at this point. The designs don’t always make sense—how is a T-rex-wyvern hybrid not stronger than a super long-necked black dragon? It’s strange when you can take multiple hits from the former, but one fire breath from the latter and you're absolutely down.

Weapons: 9/10
The concept is superb and the variety is awesome; there’s something for everyone. Balancing could use a touch-up, but hoping that it gets addressed in the next game.",True,4787,4171,1729161525,1729161525,0,0

Those two things are terrible and the track collection is just a way to force the exploration on you. Just like the small birds you collect in Rise to buff your stats which is a far worse mechanic.

    If you're new, like I was, the game can feel overwhelming with its huge amount of menus, features, weapons, mechanics, etc. It took a while to understand.
   And the combat takes getting used too. Depending on your weapon choice, it can feel slow and clunky. Which can turn people off before it clicks. Its NOT clunky, but the commitment heavy slower combat might feel that way until you adjust.
    It is now some of my favorite combat in any game.

       I spent some time on this game on console, but fell off. Years later, I tried Monster Hunter Rise, a newer, smaller scale mobile MH game. And that one made it click.

    But dang it! The game play, environments, monsters, visuals, music,etc are TOP TIER. The combat is so heavy hitting and satisfying, the difficulty is engaging, just being in the world is a joy.

The progression system is simple yet effective: you gather materials from monsters to craft new weapons and armor. There are no levels here—just your own skill and the equipment you’ve earned. The variety of weapons is great (14 in total), and each combat style offers a vastly different experience, so you’re sure to find your favorite weapon. While Monster Hunter: World is fantastic in solo play, it truly shined for me in co-op, where sharing epic moments with friends took the game to a whole new level.

In short, MH:W is an engaging game that will easily keep you hooked for hundreds of hours. The gameplay is incredibly satisfying, the monsters are impressive, and the thrill of the hunt never fades. Whether solo or with a team, it’s an experience you don’t want to miss.",True,80925,80569,1728956568,1728956568,0,0

The gameplay is fun, great amount of variety for weapons, playstyles, monsters, quest, side-quests. 
The world is amazing, you can just run around not fighting and still enjoy. The progression is rewarding.
Looting, researching and optional quest / explorations give great rewards.
Playing cooperative is awesome.

Negatives:
Some monsters become very spammy with INFINITE STAMINA and gigantic hitbox, so with some weapons, you CAN'T dodge some of their attacks regardless of timing and direction. And these monsters usually take 70% of max HP in a single attack.
I keep upgrading my armor and it seems to do nothing at all, but at least it is still an option to do.
The monster AI can become weird, I mean a monster just runs away, when you attack it again it screams locking you in place, hits you instantly for half your HP, screams again stunning you and goes away and repeats this process for half an hour: Yes, it is the DEVILJHO, the most annoying thing I ever encountered after Barioth.

Personal note: I don't think there is i-frame in this game.....I learned dodging from Dark Souls, compared to evading in that game, this is a NIGHTMARE
And whoever made the Barioth ice boss, yeah, you probably never played the game yourself. Giant chunk of hitbox just flying and dashing all over the place stunlocking you every time. Thank you for forcing me through that pain and suffering.

Oh and a side note: RAJANG SHOULD NOT EXIST IN THE GAME, the most spammy damage-dealer jumping f**k I have ever seen. And they say Dark Souls is difficult, at least that game is balanced...
 
Still recommend the game, I'd say it is a 6,5 / 10. Just because of some monsters that are way too annoying to deal with and the sheer amount of grind to create a decent build. Oh and armor consumes a lot to upgrade, but all it does is makes you from one-shot to two-shot for a monster to cart you.",True,34135,27864,1728940361,1735158288,0,1

This was my first exposure to the vibrant world of monster hunter and the passionate community behind it. Sure the usual ""culture shocks"" awaited me when I first booted up the game years ago on my PS4. Clunky weapon controls, difficulty curves beyond anything I experienced at the time....but it never really discouraged me. I kept at it, eventually falling in love with world and the franchise as a whole. The incredibly vibrant ecosystem, detailed monster behaviors and biology that appealed to my science and biology loving brain, the crazy weapons and combat that felt satisfying to get the hang of, and of course, one of the most welcoming, passionate and supportive communities I have the pleasure of knowing. 

Now, 6 years later. I'm in my last year of university, I've beaten worlds base story twice and played through rise and sunbreak on my switch. Only one thing remains before the release of wilds, beat iceborne. I hopefully can finish the daunting task before the February release date and I hope people see this and can possibly help me with this task whenever I can have some time to play. Going through world again on PC has been an incredible experience and I can't wait to see how crazy the game gets.

I know this isn't a particularly helpful review, but I just wanted to get my thoughts out on this series defining entry as we head into the biggest era of hunting yet. 

So I guess what im trying to say is, 

Thank You CAPCOM, for introducing me to this incredible series and community.

See you all in the wilds and the new world

76561198087065461,177045285,"tl;dr: Monster Hunter World is GOOD but the DLC ICEBORNE RUINS IT.

In MHWorld you feel like the game is perfectly balanced and it's fun hunting all the monsters, the fights last 10-15min so when you come home from work and play for 1-2 hours you feel like you did a lot and the gear progression is great but, as soon as you activate the garbage that is the DLC the monsters aggressivity go all the way up to 1000%, all their hitboxes are broken and the gear progression is the worst in the franchise, you spend more time running after the monsters who are now jumping around like they all suddenly became Rajangs than actually fighting them, a fight that should be 10 minutes becomes a 25-35min run just for the sake of it as CAPCOMs idea of difficulty is making the monster run away from you and triple their HP.

Also not being able to skip cutscenes should be a crime.

All your gear from MHW becomes garbage in ICEBORNE and you have to grind it all over again, some people like the grind but if you work and have little to no time to play, it feels like a huge waste of time and it makes you feel like all the time you spent playing the base game was for nothing.

76561199440244901,177021013,"TLDR: Totally Inaccurate Combat Simulator: Dinosaurs Edition.

Story 3/10: Yawn, compel me. I want to be compelled. This isn't compelling.
Graphics/Audio 8/10: Only thing big studios get right anymore.
Gameplay 3/10: When eating food is more entertaining than the combat.
Features 2/10: So many useless features that make this game worse than it should be.
Price 2/10: Big studio graphics = big studio prices. 
Overall 1.8/5 You could've had lightning in a bottle. This is a smelly fart in a jar. Just gross.


Genuinely the combat in an action RPG matters more than all the other BS you can do in it. 
That being said; this game utterly fails at that combat.

People call it ""slow"". No. It's inaccurate. You cannot nudge your character in a direction while in the middle of an attack. It holds you from making evasive maneuvers and blocking. Combined; it makes the combat feel ""inaccurate"".

I don't care about wirebugs, I don't care about pets, I don't care about the story, I don't care about camps and canteens...I don't care about 90% of the crap this series has to offer and the one thing I do care about feels so crappy that I cannot even for a second recommend this game to anyone who wants immersive, entertaining combat. On the off chance you want to feel like YOU could be a better Monster Hunter than YOUR CHARACTER; by all means - waste the money and enjoy the worst action in an ARPG to date.

And for the naysayers - I don't want to be restricted to one or two weapons just for the sake of alleviating a miniscule percentage of the overarching issue.

There is way too much ""IDGAF about this stupid feature"" in this game and not enough ""Hell yeah that fight felt good."" I mean Hunting a ""Great"" creature across a sandbox level because it gets wounded and runs away like a bitch every 3 minutes is probably the biggest indicator this game should stay out of your library. ""Great"" my ass, just like this game.

Also; can we start making these ARPGs with PvP elements? Do we not understand what players want to do once their characters are OP? The aspect of being able to fight other players is what's gonna keep pushing me (and other players) through games with craptastic stories and gameplay loops. Just saying.

How to make this game better:
1. Ability to change directions during most attacks and/or allow dodge to interrupt most attacks.
2. Reduce the material items pool.
3. Replace the slinger thing with a grippy glove so you can ""rest"" while wall climbing. Also removes the needs for vine walls.
4. Reduce or remove the ""scared little bitch"" feature from ""Great"" beasts.
5. Add PvP elements.
6. Remove the necessity for sheathing weapons to do other things. It is literally the opposite of a QoL feature.
7. Introduce someone; ANYONE with a personality, that can carry a boring story forward.",False,716,435,1728885714,1728887910,0,1

Just goofying around and going on some basic expeditions is so much fun, don't even get me started on the mainline quests. 
Although in my opinion, some of the special moves could a little more fast paced to use (depending on the weapon you choose), and the extra gadgets you obtain could be used in more significant ways, or with a single button press instead of cycling through a menu every single time, they're still pretty fun mechanics to utilize and still are really well designed, personally i always prefer beating the living hell out of the monsters, but the capture options are also great fun (when you're not trying to capture a giant fire-breathing dragon that is), and even with all that, playing the game with a friend makes it 10x times more fun, as it's also a really good co-op game suprisingly.
All in all, it's a super well made game that's really really fun and addicting, currently in my top 10 games ever, with only 18h played for now, and planning to play much more, for anyone a fan of fighting giant monsters with either a big sword, a big hammer, or both, it's a must have game.

76561199088094234,176961557,"Monster Hunter: World is hands down one of the best games I’ve ever played. It is truly s a masterpiece that offers a captivating blend of exploration, combat, and camaraderie.

Environment
The environments in Monster Hunter: World are absolutely breathtaking. From the lush jungles of the Ancient Forest to the arid expanses of the Coral Highlands, each area is rich with detail and teeming with life. The dynamic weather and day-night cycles add an extra layer of immersion, making every hunt feel fresh. You can stumble upon a hidden waterfall, witness a thunderstorm rolling in, or marvel at the vibrant flora and fauna. The attention to detail is remarkable and truly enhances the exploration experience.

Game Mechanics
The game mechanics are intuitive yet deep, allowing both newcomers and seasoned players to find their footing. The addition of the Scoutflies makes tracking monsters straightforward without feeling overly hand-holding. Each hunt requires you to adapt your strategy based on the environment and the monster you’re facing, which keeps the gameplay engaging.

Weapon Types and Mechanics
Speaking of strategy, let’s talk about the weapon types. The variety is staggering—14 distinct weapon classes, each with its own unique playstyle. Whether you prefer the fast-paced attacks of the dual blades or the tactical, defensive play of the lance, there’s something for everyone. I’ve spent countless hours mastering the intricacies of different weapons, learning the timing for combos, and farming teostra for gems.. However, a lot of weapons only shine in endgame as a lot of rare jewels are needed to make them work well. 

Creatures and Monsters
The monsters themselves are a highlight of the game. Each creature is not just a target but a complex ecosystem element with its own behaviors and weaknesses. The thrill of tracking down a Great Jagras to Fatalis, studying its patterns, and finally bringing it down with your team is unmatched. The variety of monsters—from the majestic Elder Dragons to the smaller, more mischievous creatures—ensures that every hunt feels unique.

Events and Community
The community events also deserve a mention. Regular updates and seasonal events keep the game fresh and exciting. Whether it’s a special collaboration or a new monster to hunt, there’s always something to look forward to. It’s great to see developers actively engaging with the community, listening to feedback, and continually adding content that enriches the experience. 

In summary, Monster Hunter: World is an incredible adventure that combines stunning visuals, deep mechanics, and a vibrant world teeming with life. It’s not just about slaying monsters; it’s about the journey, the friendships you forge along the way, and the thrill of mastering your craft. If you’re looking for a game that offers endless replayability and a world to lose yourself in, look no further.

76561198853103939,176960099,"I come from playing Rise before this one. I got this game to play with friends and because I was constantly told that World is far superior than Rise by several people. 

I have encountered many issues with this game. It's progression felt much slower and much less rewarding in every aspect. I like the expeditions in this game way more, but they serve no real purpose up until high rank where they give them the only purpose of discovering high rank variants of monsters over there to unlock the quest to beat them. This caused me issues because after reaching high rank, I immediately went and did a quest for the chef cat in high rank rotten valley where I saw a high rank odogaron. It took me over 20 odogaron from that quest or the expeditions to make 4 out of 5 pieces of its armor, because the expedition rewards are genuinely bad. Despite what I said earlier, getting the actual quest to fight a monster after discovering it while you go through high rank expeditions, quests are still locked by your hunter rank. This meant that my only source of odogaron materials were expeditions and that one quest from the chef for a while since I was forced to progress through the story if I wanted to get the odogaron hunt quest or if I wanted to get investigations for it instead of Radobaan or Great Girros investigations non-stop. I even managed to get gems from the thing before ever getting one of the five bones I needed for the last piece of gear. As for weapons, elemental damage is really bad with my weapon class of choice so I was basically locked to play with the ore weapon or any other physical damage one. Although even if elemental damage was any good, 90% of the weapon designs are the basic ore or bone weapons with skin from the monsters glued to them and it is like this across all the weapon classes for the entire duration of the game. When it comes to the ancient dragons, they aren't even fun to fight because they are barely capable of fighting back or they have the most annoying gimmick ever that does nothing but slow down the fight by a lot.

However, I decided to rush through the base game to start the expansion and so far none of my issues have been addressed or improved by a lot. If anything, new issues have appeared. The clutch claw that was more of an optional thing through the base game has become a must in this DLC where it was added, making the gameplay loop more boring and repetitive. The general idea is that you have to soften body parts in order to do actual damage to the monsters as well as using other mechanics related to the claw, like an attack to make monsters run into a wall and crash against it. So basically the DLC has done nothing but slow down the game by a lot so far. It feels like I gotta wait a while for my turn to soften body parts as the monster just relentlessly swings at me and I just move around it to avoid getting hit, then I have to pray to god when I get on a body part with the claw that it doesn't do an attack to get me off of it and start all over.

76561199093759048,176918287,"[b]Today is a special day for me! It's my birthday! And as I reflect on past memories, there's one story that stands out, which ties into why I’m reviewing the game Monster Hunter: World on Steam.[/b]

After an unforgettable educational trip to Japan, where I met my wife, life took a different turn. About a year or two later, during winter, my friend and I decided to organize a cabin getaway with two girls from our class, including my girlfriend. We were all from the same class except for one girl, who was from another, but we all had gone on that educational trip to Japan together. This wasn't just any trip; it took some effort to plan since accommodations back then were a bit pricier than they are now. But with determination, we made it happen.

The cabin we stayed at had a stunning fireplace that created a cozy atmosphere, perfect for those cold winter nights. It also featured hot baths where we could unwind and enjoy our time together. Memories from that trip are a bit hazy after all this time, but the excitement of the upcoming fireworks show was fresh in our minds.

My friend and I knew there were two spots to watch the fireworks: one from the resort and another higher up on the mountain. We both agreed that the view from the mountain was far better for my secret plans of losing my virginity to my girlfriend, who was completely unaware of my intentions.

We knew that one girl and my girlfriend wanted to stay at the resort, while my friend and I, along with the third girl, were eager to head to the mountain. To resolve this disagreement, my friend had a genius idea. We decided to play a poker game. He decided to side with the third girl and my girlfriend to convince them to accept the poker game. By aligning himself with them, he made it seem like he was genuinely interested in staying at the resort, making the poker game appear like a fun way to resolve the situation.

But just in case we lost, we had discussed a Plan B. The night before, while relaxing in the hot tubs, my friend and I talked about what we would do if the poker game didn’t work out. He suggested that if we lost, he would head to the hot baths for a while and create a distraction.

After the poker game, which we unfortunately lost, my friend put Plan B into action. He went to the hot baths, and once he was there, I took a moment to talk with my girlfriend about my plans for the evening. She was on board, excited about the idea of spending some intimate time together.

As planned, my friend stayed in the hot baths longer than expected, letting the girls wonder how long he was going to remain there. To heighten the drama, he pretended to faint, making it look like the heat had gotten to him. Suddenly, all eyes turned to him, and a crowd began to gather. The entire resort was buzzing with concern, creating a crazy moment for my friend to play his role. He expertly kept the girls entertained and distracted, allowing me to lead my girlfriend out for a private moment.

With everyone focused on my friend’s ""fainting,"" we finally got the time we had been hoping for. After a little while, my friend “woke up” from his faint, continuing the act to ensure that no one suspected what was happening. The chaos provided the perfect cover for us.

It was all about teamwork! Much like in Monster Hunter: World, where you need to cooperate with your buddies sometimes to hunt a bigger monster. That night, my buddy and I had a goal to ""hunt"" my devirginization, and the teamwork we displayed was truly awesome.

Now, at 82 years old, just like my wife, I look back on that winter cabin getaway as one of the most unforgettable experiences of my life.",True,741,741,1728762741,1728763209,5,1

76561198043853041,176889959,"For all of it's faults, this remains my favourite game of all time.
I have put hundreds of hours over several consoles into this game alone. The feeling of enjoyment I get from it now, is pretty much the same as the enjoyment I got from it at the start. If I get bored, I just try a new weapon. 
Some elements of this game do wear thin over time, but it's the VIBE of the MH series as a whole that really manages to captivate me.
At it's core you get a fun game where you get to hunt cool monsters, which get mechanically harder as you progress, and make equipment out of the parts that you gain from hunting those monsters. That's the pitch.
Under the surface you get a rich world, an ecosystem with established lore that doesn't feel awkward to come into as a newcomer, the combat system is satisfying and rewarding, and if you play this game to the end you WILL have a favourite fight. The level of detail in this game at times, is insane. The animations that play as the cats cook for you, the routines those cats have OUTSIDE of those animations. I know the Meowscular Chef,or his Seliana mentor are going to cook the same feast I see every time I eat at the canteen. I am still going to watch the animation play out because they absolutely didn't need to do that, but they did and as a result, it adds to the charm that this game has.
The cast of diverse and whimsical characters that you become attached to, love, and hate, are a testament to the feeling that this game has in spades. The story of Monster Hunter is never the main appeal, as much as it is a vehicle to progress you to the next big bad, but even knowing this they manage to create memorable interactions between you and these distinct personalities.
Even the base camps are designed to look grandiose and are somewhere between Studio Ghibli and The Flintstones. 
The feeling of seeing Astera for the first time will always stick with me.
To me, it feels cozy, and familiar, and I think if you can get past the initial bloat and overwhelming amount of information thrown your way, I think it will feel that way to you too.
This is the one that has made me a lifelong fan, even going back and playing older entries just to have MORE.

The only complaint i have is that playing the main story as two people that just barely bought the game as Co-op is a HORRIBLE experience. The coded the game so that you cant watch cutscenes together, so you BOTH have to watch them alone on ur own run THEN call in an S.O.S. which your friend can use to only then join in...it is incredibly stupid.

The good news is that once you get past this stupid mechanic, the game itself is AMAZING with friends!! This is the type of game where the true game doesnt start until you beat the main story. I mean, the rabbit hole goes FAR and i truly would HIGHLY recommend buying this as a solo or co op game.

p.s. play the main story solo unless with irl friends, you only get to experience this once and if you invite randoms then it will trivialize the difficulty for the majority of fights.

[h2]OVERVIEW:[/h2]

With around 315 hours under my belt and 93 out of 100 achievements unlocked, I’d say I’m pretty invested—though I know there are true veterans out there with even crazier numbers. Still, this game has kept me hooked like no other, and every hunt feels like time well spent. Let’s break it down:

[table] [tr] [th]CATEGORY[/th] [th]RATING[/th] [th]COMMENTS[/th] [/tr] [tr] [td]GRAPHICS[/td] [td]★★★★☆[/td] [td]Visuals so crisp you can practically feel the scales on those monsters. Every environment is a work of art.[/td] [/tr] [tr] [td]STORYLINE[/td] [td]★★★☆☆[/td] [td]The story lays down just enough lore to set the stage for your journey, connecting you to the world and the monsters within it. But at its core, Monster Hunter is all about the thrill of the chase, and the plot knows when to step back and let the hunts take the spotlight.[/td] [/tr] [tr] [td]COMBAT MECHANICS[/td] [td]★★★★★[/td] [td]Every weapon feels like a whole new game.

[h2]THE BREAKDOWN:[/h2]

[h3]GRAPHICS AND ENVIRONMENT DESIGN:[/h3]

The graphics in Monster Hunter are stunning, creating immersive worlds that draw you in from the very start. Each locale—from the sun-drenched deserts to the shadowy forests—boasts incredible detail and vibrant colors. The attention to environmental effects, like weather changes and lighting shifts, makes each hunt feel dynamic and alive. You’ll often find yourself pausing just to take in the breathtaking vistas.

[h3]STORYLINE AND LORE:[/h3]

While the overarching story may not be the primary draw, the lore adds a rich background to your adventures. There’s just enough narrative to give context to your hunts, introducing you to unique cultures and traditions within the game. You’ll meet various characters who add depth to the experience, but the game wisely keeps the focus on the action and excitement of hunting formidable beasts.

[h3]COMBAT MECHANICS:[/h3]

This is where Monster Hunter truly shines. Each weapon class feels distinct, offering a variety of playstyles that cater to different preferences. The combat system rewards timing and precision, making every encounter a thrilling test of skill. The ability to learn monster behaviors and adapt your strategy keeps fights fresh and engaging. Plus, the satisfaction of finally taking down a challenging monster is second to none.

[h3]MULTIPLAYER EXPERIENCE:[/h3]

The multiplayer aspect enhances the overall gameplay, turning hunts into epic team efforts. Whether coordinating attacks or sharing resources, there’s something incredibly rewarding about working together with friends. The game fosters a sense of camaraderie that can lead to some unforgettable moments—like pulling off a last-minute save or celebrating a hard-fought victory. Just be prepared for some friendly banter and chaos along the way!

[h3]SOUND & MUSIC:[/h3]

The audio design perfectly complements the gameplay, immersing you in the action. Each monster has unique sounds that build tension as they approach, while the soundtrack intensifies during battles, making every encounter feel epic. You’ll find yourself humming the tunes long after you’ve logged off, as they capture the essence of your adventures.

[h2]FINAL THOUGHTS:[/h2]

315 hours in, and I’m still finding reasons to come back. Monster Hunter is a commitment, but for those of us who love the grind, it’s the gift that keeps on giving. If you’re ready to lose track of time and hunt your heart out, this one’s a must-play.",True,18876,18847,1728572609,1730744141,1,0

The game was too hard for me so it just wasn't fun :( Any potential 24+ hours worth of content waiting for me I never bothered to hold curiosity for; I was just going to pet the piggy and mine ores. No more monster hunting for me. I have not touched the series since.

Then the hype made me buy World. It is soooooo good and I don't know why!! It's nothing like the ridiculously hard game I was first introduced to. There are still a couple monsters I can't beat without help, but that's okay. Based on what others are also saying it looks like they deliberately made this one easier than the older titles, and I think that was a good decision. World is playable and enjoyable enough for a super casual player like me.

I also really like exploring the ecosystem--the game's insanely full of life. This one time I saw a Savage Deviljho with a Viper Kadachi in its mouth, so I threw a flash bomb at the big bad bully. Savage Deviljho walked away confused and Viper Kadachi was able to return home. I had saved the little guy!! So proud of myself.

The Good:
- Addicting Combat and GamePlay Loop
- Looks Better then All Other MH gamers
- 32h-in and i only just scratch the surfice of all the game mechanics
- Cute CATS !

The Bad 
- Don't buy it for a Co-Op experiance (it just sucks)*
- The Questing system is a bit outdated and kinda anoying.
- at the start it bombards you with Tutorials.
- The UI logic is also a bit strange and purpusfully annoying.

* so me and a pair of friends bought these game for the ""Co Op"" Experience and its so bad. 
its just not designd for it. its more like a Singel player with helpers.

Multiplayer: 
- There is no party system
- One player has to start their quest and then other can join... BUT!
-- if you are lower level rank than you cant join that quest 
-- if that player has not yet seen the Cutscens you must wait and then join
- and there is more pointless and bad design choices

Conclusion:
Its a Weird addicting game.
Hope they fix this things in the new one.

76561198091990854,176527464,"To the untrained observer, Monster Hunter World may look like a typical action RPG with a more prehistoric aesthetic. But don't let that fool you. The Monster Hunter series is truly unique, and it might take some personal adjustment if you're more accustomed to games like Elden Ring or Devil May Cry. If you're thinking about getting into this series, there are a couple of things you should know. 

First and foremost, progression is determined by equipment. You do not level up your character in any fashion beyond the upgrade-able armor and weapons that your character uses. 

Second, play-style is determined by the weapons that you wield. There are 14 weapon types in the game and you can freely alternate between them without having to worry about stat thresholds. While you should expect to change equipment regularly, you will never have to grind or respec your character to equip a weapon. 

Third, success in combat requires preparation an precision. A lot of new players tend to complain about how slow and ""clunky"" a lot of the weapon types feel. While there are plenty of speedy alternatives like Sword and Shield, Long Sword, Dual Blades, and Insect Glaive, I would say that roughly half of the weapons embody the ""slow but powerful"" play-style. This aspect of the game is very much intentional, and you'll either love it or you'll hate it. As stated earlier, there are alternatives, but don't get discouraged if the first weapon you try isn't your cup of tea. 

All that being said, Monster Hunter World is, in my opinion, the best entry the series has to offer. Impeccable level/world design; complex and dynamic enemies; a fantastic score; and some of the best boss fights in gaming history. It's definitely one of my favorites.

I played Tri as a child, being the first online game I ever played, using my mums phone to talk to my friend as we played it. I never really got to fully feel the game out being a stupid kid who didn't understand squat and not being used to the Wii controls, this made up for all that. I truly got goosebumps when during a fight the iconic theme played. The monsters, new and old look amazing as well as being interesting additions. My only complaint being I wished there were more. Even if you're not into the whole boss fight learn attack patterns genre, you will find that this is a nice way to experience that. Now, I am unsure why they decided to add the feature where the monster swallows you in detail, giving you a first person view of yourself being taken into the monsters mouth and siding down its detailed throat, with the added burping and stomach growling sounds, until you actually reach it's stomach where you then die and are met with a cut scene of the monster walking away with a bulging stomach.

Capcom needs to add some kind of new player pack that has a ton of the good decorations in it so when people actually get to the last 80% of the game (master rank) they can actually play withouyt having to send an sos flare up and watch other people kill monsters for you so you can slooooooooooowly build a gear set.

76561198248538574,176497053,"Got it during one of the many Capcom sales and all I can say is hell yeah dude! Game's awsome! Even if my PC sucks and I have to run it at lowest settings, praying to God to keep the frames stable and not have any big frame drops, the game still delivers!
An interesting but not that deep of a story, beautiful monsters and pretty ecosystems (+1 on that one as a biologist). Weapons and armour sets are GORGEOUS and gameplay in general is soooo fun!
Got the DLC a bit after I ended the main game's story and delved into the collab events (which were very fun as well) and I still haven't finished it. That's more because I haven't had the time and energy to dedicate to it since I really want to enjoy each and every fight in this game. Especially when it comes to hunting new monsters I'd never hunted before!
I've been using MnK all my life and I finally recently got a working controller and have been trying to learn how to play with it but tbh, the game's more than enjoyable enough for me in MnK.
Endgame also feels extremely enjoyable! As a Destiny 2 fan and player (ye...I know...;-;), the TRUE ENDGAME is the fashion and maaaaaaaaaaan is it so friggin enjoyable! So many beautiful sets that sit on you character perfectly! So many combinations and so many fun builds you can also make while enjoying the fact that you're so stylish!
Same goes for the weapons in this game! They're so gorgeous! Yes, above all else their gameplay and their feel matters most which is amazing but they also look so gooooood!!!
Another thing that made me enjoy and appreciate the work the devs have put in this game is the hitboxes are so amazing! Yes, they're not perfect but they still are soo gooood!

To close this off (cause I can go on for longer than this but it will take a slight toll on my already fragile sanity), this game offers an amazing experience gameplay wise, being visually stunning in some cases w/ all its environments and it's highly detailed monsters and lil critters while also offering a simple and very easy to digest story that gets you to learn more about this world and it's story!
Very excited for Monster Hunter Wilds as well!!! Hope I'll have a new PC by then to actually be able to run it! xD

- The game gives you end game armor at the start of the game....... Why the fuck would you do this? It destroys all sense of progression. ""Oh you just have to ignore it and play without it."" No fuck you. The developer decision to include that is mind blowing. It's really there for new players to be able to play with any end game friends they have but just having that armor set just sitting there destroys all progression of the entire game and it's mechanics.

- The text and graphics are blurry. Why is the text hard to read? Why is the text blurry? Even the graphics are blurry. I have max graphics settings and it looks like like smeared ass.

- This game was definitely built for people who have friends to play with. Lol. I bought it for the single player experience and I was disappointed. There are classes that are meant just for groups of people and the game starts you off the moment you start the game with end game armor. I remember when Diablo III did this in an update and it just destroyed the progression aspect of the game. Why do developers still make these same mistakes?

This is one of the best games that I have ever played that it honestly deserves my first review ever for a game. Every encounter with a monster is different. The combat is non-repetitive. There are always new things to discover in every biome and you can interact with a lot of things in the environment. Every movement and action your character makes are smooth and correspond with the surrounding perfectly. It also has full of contents that even after playing for more than 500 hours, I still have not gotten to them all. Did I mention you can also either play solo or with others like your friends?

The matchmaking system is frustrating; it’s too easy to get stuck with players who don’t communicate or know what they’re doing. Solo play can also feel punishing due to the AI companions’ lackluster performance.

Additionally, the story is almost nonexistent, which wouldn’t be a dealbreaker if the combat felt more rewarding. Instead, the lack of meaningful progression and the grind-heavy mechanics make it hard to stay invested.

76561198846709498,176364094,"[h1]""An Incredible Experience, but the Clutch Claw Missed the Mark""[/h1]

Monster Hunter: World is an absolutely amazing game that I poured countless hours into. I started on PS4 and then transitioned to PC, and in both versions, the experience was phenomenal. My friend and I would often find ourselves saying, “just one more hunt,” only to realize it was suddenly 5 in the morning and we had work coming up soon! It’s that addictive and fun.

The base game felt polished and thrilling, with each hunt feeling unique and exciting. The weapon variety, monster designs, and the overall atmosphere of the world were spot-on, and it kept me hooked for hours on end. When Iceborne dropped, it added so much new content, a fresh area, tons of new monsters, and a new hunting rank to grind through. It should have been perfect.

But then came the Clutch Claw. For me, this was the one downside. It felt like a forced mechanic that disrupted the flow of combat. Instead of focusing on my usual Charge Blade strategy, like firing off my amped elemental discharge, I had to stab the monster with the Clutch Claw to weaken it first. It just didn’t click for me, and it felt like the monsters health pools were balanced around using it, which detracted from the overall experience.

That said, Monster Hunter: World is still one of the best games I’ve ever played, and I’m beyond excited for the next entry in the series. The Clutch Claw might not have been my favorite addition, but it didn’t overshadow the fact that this game is a masterpiece in every other way.",True,18709,18709,1728063416,1728063416,1,0

But, I gotta say, this game could use some work in the graphics department. When I first started playing, everything was super blurry and it was a bit of a turn-off.

Monster Hunter World comes close to perfection. It has a few flaws, like imperfect hitboxes, unskippable cinematics and credits, and the occasional frustration of missing loot drops because they’re hard to spot. Fortunately, the game has an active modding community that helps address some of these issues.

The game truly shines in its gameplay and customization. Each weapon offers a unique playstyle, allowing you to find what suits you best. For me, the bow, hammer, and switch axe were perfect, each offering a different experience that kept the gameplay fresh. This diversity in weapon mechanics makes it easy to replay the game without it feeling repetitive, as each weapon introduces new ways to approach hunts.

In terms of design and story, Monster Hunter World is richly detailed and immerses you in the role of a hunter exploring a ""new world."" The ecosystem feels alive, with monsters engaging in territorial battles and even retreating to recover. While sometimes frustrating when monsters run too often, this can work to your advantage, allowing you to strategize with traps. The story is straightforward and easy to follow, adding just enough context to the exploration.

Each monster has unique traits and weaknesses, making it rewarding to study and prepare for each hunt. Although the difficulty can be challenging, careful preparation—like eating the right food, crafting potions, and setting traps—ensures that every monster is beatable. For experienced players, diving straight into action and treating the game like a series of boss fights is a thrilling option.

Overall, Monster Hunter World is packed with content to enjoy at your own pace. For just 20 euros, the main game and DLC offer an incredible value and are well worth it.",True,5652,5651,1727953248,1730289892,0,0

If you're interested in the series this is a great one to start with.

Intense fights at an epic scale, tons of customization and the ability to tailor your playstyle to each monster for an easier fight without being necessary to progress allows for fun progression and a high skillcap when you get to endgame. worth a buy on sale for sure",True,16432,16432,1727894790,1727894790,0,0

Unskippable cutscenes and busywork drag the whole experience down. Part of the ""appeal"" is getting better at weapons but that means you have to put in hours of practice against frankly repetitive bosses to learn these skills. It doesn't help that in order to craft better weapons and armor you have to kill bosses multiple times so in order to get a better sword or whatever you're going to have to repeat the same boss multiple times until the part you want drops.
It's an immersive time sink if you don't have responsibilities but if you only have a few hours free every week for gaming I don't think you'll have a good time.

However, I think the enjoyment from this game heavily outweighs the minor negatives, and once you got used to the combat, it's actually super intuitive. This game's world is gorgeous with the texture pack, characters' armour are aesthetically pleasing, combat is smooth, weapons has heft and weight to them (when it needs to be), and the fights are extremely engaging!

76561198023189786,176132582,"I really enjoy this game! If you are looking for a Souls-like game with grinding (where one shot can kill you and requires skillful dodging), set in a world of monsters, you must try this one. You can hunt the same monster with many different weapons, and in my opinion, it's even more enjoyable to play with others, even if they aren’t your friends. This is a Monster Hunter game that strikes a balance between realism and fantasy. I like this much more than the Rise title.

What I don't like about this title:
 - Tactics around hunting don't seem to matter, such as tracking the monster in the middle of the game. It feels like you're just wasting time walking to their path/nest to fight the boss with a navigator.
 - Trapping/item is only useful for capturing monsters to get more rewards or stun them. You can simply build main on attack power, and one build solves everything. Other tactics or features are more for fun. I would prefer the game to increase the intensity by making each monster require a different approach to hunting, demanding more preparation.
 - Armor doesn’t matter much if you can dodge everything. Most useful armor is late-game armor no one care much for small monster armors, and there's no need to adapt skills or stats for different environments just make different way to increase ATK power each weapons. it may be one of the reason that game provides Layered Armor for customization looks.
 - the design of some armors and weapons feels out of theme. It looks more like something from a fashion show or an other MMORPG with the same color of monsters.
 - Some designs don't make me feel like they are part of the monster. While event/collab gear is acceptable, I prefer armor and weapons that reflect the look of the monsters themselves.
 - Part dropping feels repetitive. Only a few rewards require specific part destruction, so you end up just killing as fast as possible until it drops, without much strategy.
 - Grinding to get Gacha is very painful.

Its just so good man theres nothing else I can say, what beautiful levels and graphics and sound.

My only 2 complaints about this game...

1 The cut-scenes are painfully long, boring, unnecessary, and THEY CANNOT BE SKIPPED.

** There is a mod that lets you skip cut-scenes so, it does help A LOT.

2 You can't join friends until you or they have seen the cut-scenes in-game. It's honestly stupid that you can't just watch it together and go about your way.

I strongly suggest that you experience Genshin Impact, a great epoch-making game from China, rather than a failed work like Monster Hunter: World, which makes the world see jokes. It is evident that Japan's gaming development has fallen behind China by at least ten years. There is a saying in China that ""Cannot see the wood for the trees"".

76561198037513682,175999301,"Truthfully, I love this game. Played it religiously on its original PS4 release and came to revisit and experience the stuff I didn't get to then after not liking Rise very much. If I didn't have hard nostalgia for 3U, this would be my favourite Monster Hunter by a country mile. However, I still dearly wish Steam had a sideways thumb option because while it does excel in many aspects in my eyes, they're in very peculiar niche ways that are uncommon if not detrimental to the experience one would want or expect from a Monster Hunter title, and when it misses it misses hard, especially now that its nearly a decade past its relevancy.

To be brief: I find that Worldborne is at its best if you enjoy it as a solo experience at your own pace and don't worry too much about getting super sweaty with gearing, but that feels like an irresponsible rec considering what MH is as a series and what this particular game asks of the player along its progression.

MHW and its expac Iceborne really endeared themselves to me personally because my favourite parts of 3U and 4U were the freehunting and the everwood expeditions, so a whole game with those modes of hunting at the fore was so up my alley it was basically a turkey. The joke with my friends was ""I have 500 hours and 499 of them are expeditions"". These and controversially the Guiding Lands in IB's endgame are absolutely perfect for me, where often I reach points in these games when I've farmed everything I want or want to take a break from the grind but still want to play the game, but don't really want or need to do anything specific. Just slap me in an expedition and I'll become an extinction event for fun. If you have those similar sorts of cravings of just wanting to dick around in something that feels good to play, this'll scratch that hard.

I was also drawn into the series by its fascinating setting and worldbuilding, so a more immersive experience exploring those in a more direct ways was exciting. Unfortunately this is where the first major hitch is, which is that the progression hinges on the story mode directly, but it's set up such that players have to see the attached cinematics on their own before they can group up with friends. The cutscenes are unskippable, and the story is merely serviceable at best, if you've played any other MH you'll know the writing's never been its strong suit. If you don't have the taste for it, the cinematic focus on it makes it feel a lot worse than it is, and it makes multiplayer needlessly clunky for those wanting to co-op the main campaign. Further hampering multiplayer is semi-regular connection issues.

The next big hitch is that the general gear/mechanical progression did not age well at all. Unlike past MHs there is a lot of NPC chatter and tutorializing right out the gate, and this continues even into endgame where certain encounters try to spice things up with different mechanics, field gimmicks, etc, but they end up feeling patronizing to veterans and overwhelming to new and unfamiliar players. Speaking of the new player experience, they default new characters to Defender gear, which is a huge noob trap. Absolutely do not use this if its your first time through. The general pacing of the content without the forced downtime between title updates also makes their difficulty spikes that much harsher, such as going from the base game campaign into iceborne's campaign, or when IB's endgame opens up.

A lot of this is compounded by the Worldborne gearing system being something different compared to games prior or since, but the lack of variety was rightfully criticized since the initial release, and the general trend of entirely vertical gear progression thanks to TU powercreep is probably some of the worst gearing in the series. The menuing in this game is also particularly poor, sorting out your gearsets and item sets are way more convoluted than they need to be. Often the best gear comes from sieges, which are an interesting take on whole-lobby multiplayer, but the avaliable quests cycle weekly-ish as a live-service-ism, and only one of the two is actually somewhat interesting to face with. I think Safi'jiiva might be one of the most boring fights in the series and I'm the type that willingly hunts Ceadeus.

MH has historically had balance issues but its gotten frustrating, since they've reached a point where nothing is [i]unplayably bad[/i], but the stuff that's good is so head and shoulders above the rest it's hard to avoid [see: LS in Rise]. The biggest Gammoth in the room with this is the clutch claw, which completely trivializes lower ranks and neuters monster behaviors even if you don't actively use it thanks to the half-stun state they added to all mons to encourage use of it. In usual MH fashion they had to design around it and other polarizing pieces like the temporal mantle to make things actually ""difficult"" come Iceborne, so you're either having to spam wallbangs to keep monsters downed 24/7 or are a masochist like me. From the few weapons I've played between my files [SA, Hammer, and IG] it's a total crapshoot on whether or not CCing even feels good to begin with.

Lastly... the mtx is embarassing man. Sure its all optional cosmetics and stupid shit like room decor, but so was horse armour. There's over $500 of it and the game itself doesnt hesitate to let you know about it. Worst part about this is they show no signs of stopping since all people care about is dressup.

A lot of this is alleviated by the fact you can pick up World and IB for like 15 bucks rather frequently. it's a great game but it tries to have its cake and eat it too in many awkward and outdated ways. its hard to recommend because its a great solo experience until it isn't, at the expense of its multiplayer until it doesn't.",False,25597,25320,1727587210,1727594988,2,0

It can be clunky and some missions can be a drag but that aside this game is perfect for me. I loved having to learn the monsters attacks and to make the right builds to progress further. I loved catching the endemic life and placing them in my home especially the rare endemic life since it added so much for those who decided to look deeper. I'll never forget the times I've had with my friends fighting Kulve together, I'll never forget running to the top of Hoarfrost to check for the Wintermoon Nettle during quests and I'll never forget the first time I beat Fatalis. Now 36 Fatalis kills later and every armour type, every endemic life, every weapon (safi weapons included), every layered equip, every decoration, every pendant and every furniture type collected, my Monster Hunter World journey ends..

-big monsters
-big fights
-awesome armor customization 
-multiplayer has meaningful stakes

my only gripe is that the multiplayer is a slog to access in the BEGINNING. Due to the restricted manner that new players  have anyone join them it really takes the momentum out of CO-OP progress (side by side story wise). Certain areas and newer monsters have a cinematic you MUST watch SOLO before anyone can join you through SOS or the quest board in the lobby. Unless you already know where to go for the cutscene it can be awhile just finding it if you are new.

This problem is only present at the beginning of your new hunter, maybe 5% maximum has this clunky experience. Once a multiplayer restriction is gone for that particular hunt it doesn't show up again. 

That aside...the gameplay feels great and the environments and monsters are some of the most lifelike in the Monster Hunter series.

In short
1/10 not enough water, water combat or Lagiacrus.

76561198811328395,175760729,"It's fun as an action game, but the multiplayer system is trash. Some of the quests essentially force you to play with other people, and one of my biggest issues with this is the fact that sometimes connection errors occur randomly in the middle of the quest, but the person isn't always able to rejoin especially if the online session fills up before they can rejoin. 

For the more casual quests where multiplayer isn't heavily encouraged, the HP of the monster scales up with the number of players. Unfortunately, when a person leaves a quest, the HP of the monster stays the same. For example, if a monster has 1000 HP with one player and then 2000 with 2 players, if one of the players gets disconnected thus leaving the quest, the monster's HP will remain at 2000 even though there is technically only one player in the quest. 

Aside from that, there are certain bugs that are utterly frustrating, like how the cat sometimes is in the middle of using the vigorwasp delivery, but then suddenly stops for no apparent reason. There's also a bug where the monster will run on the wall, crushing the player underneath. Most of the time this will kill the player because you aren't able to get away from the monster, dive doge, or heal because it's flinching you from running on the wall. 

There are times the monster also goes outside of the map where players cannot go... and if this happens while you are riding the monster, it makes you fall off. But there's no way to prevent this from happening, you just have to cross your fingers and hope the monster doesn't go outside the map.",False,35628,34572,1727285183,1727285406,1,0

Every failure pushed us to adjust our tactics, refine our builds, and communicate better as a team. When we finally emerged victorious, the feeling was unmatched—utter triumph after so much perseverance!

However, there are several things that weigh the experience down. The story forcing you to load into quests solo, watch the unskippable cutscene, then have you or your friend leave their instance in order to play together is a major pain point. The lack of  proper weapon tutorials hurts on-boarding for new players, as they need to consult third party guides just to understand how their weapon functions. Menus are annoying at best and unintuitive at worst. While most of the issues I've mentioned so far are minor in the grand scheme of things, a major gripe I have with the game has to do with the unequal treatment of weapons in regard to dealing elemental damage. Having half of your arsenal be objectively inferior to just using a weapon with more raw damage hurts build diversity, and is incredibly disappointing when you want to build around a monster's weakness, only to end up doing worse because your weapon isn't good for elemental damage. Also having the Frostfang Barioth Charge Blade be impact phial was just evil.",True,21534,20810,1727213983,1727213983,0,0

76561199201204193,175635215,"Is this a good monster hunter game? Yes. Do I think it's perfect? Far from it.

Pros:
* Amazing cutscenes
* Decent story for a Monster Hunter game
* The weapons feel good to use (at least the ones I tried)
* Most of the new monsters have great designs and fights
* The mantles are a decent new addition

Cons:
* The clutch claw is not only janky with nonsensacle physics, it is necessary to beat most late game monsters in iceborne if you're playing alone and it made my favorite weapon type (Dual blades) unusable until the post game of the DLC without making insane builds for each monster
* Cutscenes are unskippable even on a second playthrough and make playing through the game with friends a nightmare with how they're implemented
* Most of the weapon designs not only look like trash, they don't even match the respective armor well

If you progress through the game normally (upgrading your armor as you go), you will have a challenging but quite enjoyable monster hunting experience. 

[b] IMPORTANT [/b] : I highly recommend to ignore the Defender set, as it will make every hunt too easy and boring. 
The armor set was made to rush through the base game and get to the DLC (Iceborne) as quickly as possible

A few Pros:
1) World and environment is beautifully crafted
2) a Lot of different monster types ; each with their own attacks to learn
3) Each monster armor sets look unique and represent each monster nicely
4) A lot of weapon variations ; each with their own unique play-styles
5) Lively and animated characters through out the game
6) a Palico (Cat) companion with extremely cute armor / fashion

A few Cons:
1) The story (not really the focus of the game)
2) Movement
3) Colour scheme can be quite lacklustre
4) Hunting time limitations and limited deaths can be a pain in the early game
5) Co-op during the story: If you wish to play with friends through the story, forget about it. It does not work.",True,4064,4064,1727100601,1727100601,0,0

76561198172276331,175547661,"It's Monster Hunter. Come on.

Extremely diverse environments that never feel ""samey"" or boring. Though the exploration is limited, and there isn't an open world, the levels are still MASSIVE, and are designed with fighting the titular Monsters in mind.

Also the Monsters. Extremely diverse, though World has an issue with pretty much every Monster being some sort of Lizard/Lizard with Wings. There's still a broad variety of Monsters, some being based on real world creatures, and others based on more fantastical designs, like Bazelgeuse, the heavily armored bomber plane, bird, dragon, thing. Or Paolumu, a furry, bat-like wyvern with an air sac in its neck that it uses to spit air pressure attacks at you. The DLC ramps things up even further, with a lot of returning designs from previous games, like the badass Tail-Sword T-Rex Glavenus, or the 5 time heavyweight boxing champ, Brachydios. 

The Armor you get from the monsters is awesome, as well. Early game, there isn't a lot of variety, and the skills you get will assist you on hunts, but never define your build, allowing you to learn your weapon more or less in a vacuum. Late game, however, they wind up being the most important part of your build, augmenting the way your weapon functions, how well you can survive, giving you damage boosts when performing specific actions, and so much more.

And of course... the weapons.
Switch Axe gang RISE UP!
14 unique different weapons that all play in very different ways. 
Greatsword, a slow, heavy hitter that rewards hit-and-run playstyles while allowing you to deal MASSIVE damage during openings.
Longsword, a flowing, counter based weapon that allows you to dodge and punish within the same attacks.
Sword and Shield, a generalist, ""Jack of All Trades"" weapon that allows for slashing, bashing, and monster thrashing. You can NEVER go wrong with SnS.
Dual Blades, a nimble, rapid hitting weapon that can attack nigh constantly while remaining on the move.
Hammer, a heavy, charging weapon that can reliably knock monsters to the ground when hitting the head.
Hunting Horn, a specialized instrument that prioritizes support and unique buffs to augment every hunter in the group.
Switch Axe, my BABY, and a combination between a slow, but far reaching Axe, and a fast, high damage Sword form. 
Charge Blade, a complex weapon, comprised of a Sword and Shield that can store energy, and transform into a long handled axe capable of dealing devastating strikes.
Lance, a defensive, counter based weapon that allows you to block nearly every attack in the game while countering with a long, heavy lance.
Gunlance, a Lance modified with a close range cannon that prioritizes shell attacks that ignore armor.
Insect Glaive, an aerial, mobile weapon that pairs up with a Kinsect that allows you to harvest extracts that enhance your abilities.
Bow, a mid-ranged weapon that fires a barrage of arrows with unique coatings from a safe distance. 
Light Bowgun, a nimble, long ranged weapon that can fire a variety of ammo types to fit any situation.
Heavy Bowgun, a powerful, heavy weapon that can fire a variety of powerful ammo types to chunk down monsters, from range, or from up close.

Of course, if you've played this game before, you already know this. But if you're reading this review, not sure whether or not to get this game (especially with Wilds coming out next year, as of writing) I can assure you, it is WELL worth it. You will get a lot out of this game, and as a Monster Hunter game, all of that experience with your respective weapon will transfer over to some extent. When I started this game, I felt like the combat was slow, clunky, and unfun to play. But I gave it a chance, and I adjusted to the movement, and to my weapon of choice. I slammed through the game with Longsword, my then favorite weapon. Switch Axe, my least favorite weapon, was a weapon I couldn't stand at all. But I decided, on a whim, to give it a chance. I started a new playthrough, and went through the entire game using it. By the end, I came out a changed man. Give it a chance. Experiment. Learn new weapons. Everything has something to offer, so if you ever think this game has bad combat, chances are, you're the one missing something. 

Also, try Rise! I recommend it after World. Rise has a lot of new systems compared to World, and is easily the more complex of the two. World is a great intro experience. 

TL;DR - This game rocks, give every weapon a chance before deciding you don't like them, and if you like this one, try Rise.",True,84000,79416,1727017629,1727017629,0,0

76561198136791201,175505623,"Monster Hunter: World offers some of the most exhilarating combat experiences in gaming, making each hunt feel dynamic and engaging. The thrill of tracking monsters, learning their patterns, and executing perfectly timed attacks is top-tier. The variety of weapons and play styles available is truly the best of the best, allowing players to find a combat approach that suits them perfectly.

However, that’s where my enthusiasm takes a nosedive. The game’s lock-on system is arguably the worst I’ve encountered in any game. Every time you move your mouse, it shifts focus to a different body part of the monster, which can be incredibly disorienting. To make matters worse, the game will auto-focus on items and other elements even when you’re in the thick of a fight, throwing off your aim and disrupting your flow. This design flaw adds unnecessary frustration to an otherwise thrilling combat experience.

The insistence on unskippable cutscenes is another major issue. Whether you’re diving into a new mission or inviting friends, you’re constantly pulled out of the action for cinematic moments that disrupt the pace. You can’t even team up for co-op play until you finish these cutscenes, forcing your friends to wait while you slog through repetitive dialogue and animations. This can quickly turn a fun gaming session into a tedious waiting game.

Additionally, every time you craft an item, you’re subjected to yet another lengthy animation. It feels as if the developers forgot that time is precious. The repetition of these forced scenes can turn what should be a smooth, immersive experience into a chore, reflecting a lack of respect for players' time.

In summary, while the combat and weapon variety in Monster Hunter: World shine brilliantly, the frustrating lock-on system, pacing issues, and unskippable scenes overshadow much of the enjoyment. It’s a classic case of a game that gets so much right but stumbles hard in the areas that impact player experience the most. If only they’d let us skip those scenes and get to the good stuff!",False,847,464,1726974447,1726977477,4,6

It’s like Pokémon, except instead of catching them, you get punted across the map by a T-Rex on steroids while trying to sharpen your sword for the 10th time.

The beauty of this game is that no matter how well-prepared you think you are, the monster you’re hunting has already read your strategy guide. One moment you’re smugly landing that perfect combo, and the next, you’re being body-slammed by a giant dragon who decided it’s time for you to experience the fast travel system... involuntarily.

Monster Hunter: World teaches valuable life lessons—like never celebrate too early, always pack more potions than you think you’ll need, and never, EVER trust a Rathalos to let you finish your BBQ spit. But hey, it’s not all bad. You get to chase after the coolest armor sets and weapons that you’ll spend 80 hours crafting, only to immediately need something better for the next beast that’s coming to ruin your day.

Instead of a rant I'll just list off some big points that are good and not so good.

Pros: 
- Excellent immersion (monsters fight each other, good level design, monsters are interesting)
- Combat is balanced and deep, easy to pick up and hard to get great with
- Armors look really neat and worth spending time to grind for
- The personal cat buddy you get makes the game humorous and fun

Cons:
- Learning the ins and outs of combos for fighting requires a good guide online 
- The multiplayer is just ok (cannot join in on a mission until they progress in story enough)
- Capturing monsters should be a bit better to do as it plays a pretty big role in missions
- The city layout is bad, not a huge deal, just ends up wasting more time than it should

I was genuinely quite worried by the accessibility changes when I first tried this game. I was worried they'd taken away what made Monster Hunter special to gain more players. But they'd made what I would consider the best Monster Hunter game to date. In the past, unfair hit boxes just became a part of the fun and you got good enough to know when and where to dodge. With World, they seem to have fixed the hit box issues and retained a very healthy roster of OG monsters while exploring new exciting monsters, without falling into the same trap of Pokemon; making goofy new additions that don't fit the theme.

76561197991294220,175248655,"Very playerunfriendly design choices ruin a possibly fun game experience.

First let me clarify that the initial review and the following is obviously subjective. While I have a hard time having fun in this game, you may very well have.

Let's start with something minor. You learn in a tutorial that to capture a monster you will have to use a particular item and use that once. Since you do not have enough knowledge in the beginning (both in and out of the game) to know when you should use it you may think it is not ready when you use it and it did not work. In fact the tutorial is weirdly the only time a monster can be captured by using the item only once. All other times you need to use it twice. It seems like this could have been a rare case in which some circumstances were met so that one was enough but this through me off for a while resulting in not capturing monsters.

Playing in multiplayer is annoying since creating a group and departing on a quest together is inconvenient since all players except the host will have to go to the quest board seperately to accept the quest.

There are several mechanics while fighting monsters which result in not being able to act. (Stun, paralyze, sleep, knockback and knockdown.) While you can avoid most attacks it is almost impossible to avoid all of them. It is quite likely to get chain-cced so that you cannot act for 10 seconds or so in a row, then healing for 2 seconds if you are lucky to not get hit again while doing so. There is a mechanic that can at least make yourself immune to the effects and most of them are monster specific so you can prepare yourself for those.
But stunning is quite common so having this resistance is almost necessary to have fun in this game. I forgot to change that and played one quest without and immediatly noticed it.

The mechanic for having these resistances is locked to progression and limited slots. This basically means that I will never remove those resistances and reducing the customization options for my build.

The interface and the controls are limited by console development. This is extremely noticeable since the interface can be a pain to navigate. Especially using hotkeys for items to use is just nonsense. Assigning these hotkeys is needlessly complicated and tied to loadout which may result in overwriting the hotkeys you just assigned so you can do the process again. Even with those hotkeys it may not even be faster to use those instead of tediously scrolling through the permanently present bar of all items since pressing just one button is not enough. First you need to press one hotkey for the bar itself to appear, then you need to wait a second so it will recognize the pressed button and use the item.

Adding to that keys have to be assigned multiple times due to the limited buttons on a controller. This leads to unwanted actions like walking or sprinting and jumping outside of a fight results in a simple and quick dodge. Doing so in a fight is different, walking does the same but sprinting and jumping will make the character dodge in a dive which may have more invincibility frames but also stun you for about two seconds in which you may then be hit which would not have happened otherwise. (I actually just found out that it even differs from fighting small enemies (first behaviour) and big enemies (Second behaviour))

Another one is when changing from a melee weapon the bow. The controls for the items have been remapped to those for the ammo and the items suddenly require more buttons to be pressed for them to scroll through. While it may be possible that you could remap these manually I can't be sure since I won't try it out again. The game is sluggish when using any weapon I have tried so far, the bow is definitely no exception and felt completely unrewarding if I did hit.
When I started playing the game some controls didn't even work until I remapped a key to something else and then back.

While most of this may be due to console development I do not understand why you need to re-equip your loadout and have to eat (getting one buff for the upcoming quest) manually before every single mission. A simple option to use this or that loadout (or current) and use that meal while accepting or departing for a quest would save so much time running around and going through the inventory.

While on a mission you have access to almost everything from your equipment, be it on your character or in your stash. Changing the weapon, armor or loadout is available but swapping decorations (for resistances or damage) is not so if you forget to change one of those gems you will have to go back to the base and into the mission again.

And then there is this inconsistent design of showing stats. The main point of the game is to build your equipment specialized to your preference. To achieve that the game provides detailed percentages or flat numbers of damage or resistances from equipment or decorations. This makes sense.
And then there are items which boost your damage or defence, heal you or deal damage. How much? Well you need to find out. How long? Guess or time it. Yes, this is not a big problem but I would like some consistency.

Your ""palico"" which is an AI helping you, as long as the party is below four players, can be a life saver but also just be baiting you into your death. There is a mechanic where it is obviously coming to give you much needed health but just before reaching you it just stops and denying you the heal. This in combination with having the monster attacking your helper may result in death by betrayal. Of course the second part is something you need to be aware of but why would your palico just stop without any reason?

While most of this is not a major inconvenience by itself the amount is just killing a lot of fun. There is still more that I do not like in this game but is not necessarily player unfriendly, just questionable design.",False,9620,9617,1726674217,1728984179,0,0

76561197975565331,175247821,"This game is suffering from feature creep. I got this game four years after release and it looked like a mess. I couldn't tell what was the main game mode or what I was supposed to do and what was a microtransaction and what wasn't. It was like it was fashioned to cater to long-time players, not newbies. 

This game is similar to Horizon: Zero Dawn in being ""Breath of the Wild-y"", but it's Japanified. It's from Capcom, so you can bet there's a gruff Lone Wolf warrior, a chirpy waifu assistant, and cutesy mascot pets.

There's a huge world to explore, but it gives you a little more guidance first. This one also has you hunting dinosaurs. I still don't get the online group aspect of it yet. It's a little more ""Dark Souls""-ish in that the monsters take a ton of hits to kill but needs little strategy and timing to kill them. But they don't kill you in one hit, so it's more forgiving. However, the monsters take so many hits to kill, it's tedious. I wonder if this game is meant for a younger audience. Like, under 13. It's a little simpler, and there are kitty mascots who follow you around and you can dress up. It's part of the ""junk overhead"" that games have--herbs and crafting and cooking meat and online sessions and costumes. 

You play a customized character, so that takes away much motivation to see that character succeed. Because that character is you. Since you're customized, you have no backstory, no motivation, no needs or wants, and thus no personality. You are your avatar, but you don't know why you're hunting these monsters. You don't have anything to drive you. It's why I couldn't get into Choose Your Own Adventure books. I don't want to read or watch movies or play video games to be ME.

76561198141165016,175234408,"I don't know how it has taken me this long to write a view for this masterpiece of a game. When my friend first showed this game to me on release it didn't take my fancy as I just saw it as an ""anime game"".

TL;DR - MHW is a beautiful game with an addictive gameplay loop and Iceborne gives you even more of the base game to play through. I highly recommend anyone who likes the look of the trailers to pick it up.

MHW as a lone game is fantastic. The core gameplay revolves around venturing out into 1 of 5 (7 with DLC) areas and hunting these large monsters that wonder the landscape. This game is part of an overall series but as someone who has yet to play any other MH games, you don't need to have played previous games - in fact this is probably the best starting point. 

My favourite aspects of the game:
Every monster is somewhat believable. They all interact with their environment, whether that be fighting for land with other monsters, scratching their back against a tree, eating some meat, or just patrolling around their territory. Every monster feels real and like it doesn't just exist for quest objective sake but rather it was already there and needed to be dealt with. To add onto this point, the actual design and aesthetic of each monster is amazing. From the lowly Great Jagras all the way up to Nergigante, Fatalis and Namielle - every monster has a cool design.

The gameplay loop is incredibly addictive. It's fairly basic on paper - load into the map and run around until you either find the monster or find tracks that will then lead you to the monster. Once located you beat it into a small paste (Or it does that to you) and then you go back to the main base area. What makes it so addicting is the combat itself. As a hunter you have access to 14 different types of weapon that each have their own combo's, moves, unique characteristics and styles of fighting. Every monster also has it's own unique attacks that take time to memorise and learn the patterns of but once you perfect both you feel awesome as you leap, block, jump, smash, slice and brutalise the monster until it's barely recognisable.

The gear progression in this game is great. Whilst the endgame has a heavy emphasis on min/maxing your skills to get the highest damage possible, the actual progression throughout the game is really well implemented. Every monster you kill has several armour sets that match its design and has skills that somewhat reflect the monsters behaviours. You find yourself hunting the same monster repeatedly as you farm it for the materials in order to make the next sword or armour piece that you need to be able to beat the next monster. 

The landscape and map design is absolutely phenomenal. Whilst no Cyberpunk 2077, MHW still keeps up with the games being released 6 years later. From the sprawling green maze that is the Ancient Forest, to the boiling lava lakes and crystalline structures of the Elders Recess, this game continues to amaze me with how gorgeous it is. And this is only further enhanced by the monster design as mentioned earlier. 

What could be better:
The story is somewhat lackluster. Don't go into this game expecting Fallout NV, Cyberpunk or RDR2 levels of story telling. The story is good but for the most part it's told via on screen text and unskippable cutscenes (please Capcom, it's been 6 years - let me skip them). It is based around the mystery of the 'Elder Crossing' and finding out why these incredibly powerful monsters are being drawn to the New World. It's a good premise and is somewhat interesting, but for the most part I was focused on beating up the next monster so I could get myself a new hat. 

It's somewhat complex. The weapon tree can be slightly daunting at first glance, with there being so many different weapons with different numbers, symbols, colours etc. Once you go and google what they mean or read the in game tutorials (which are length) it is understandable and you realise you can ignore 80% of the weapon tree as they aren't as good as the other 20%. 

Monster Hunter? More like Menu Hunter. When you aren't fighting a monster, you are fighting against the menu's. You will spend so much time sorting out your item box, taking your crafting items out of your botanical box, making custom meals, organising your load outs and item wheel for different monsters, locales and weapons. Whilst I don't think this should put you off buying this game, it certainly can be an unexpected aspect of the game to new players that can be quite confusing. 

Monster Hunter World: Iceborne further amplifies the base game. It is essentially Monster Hunter World 2, being the same length, if not longer, than the base game and adding in tons of new and returning monsters to hunt. The story is again pretty middling, but if you enjoy the base game it is definitely worth picking up Iceborne too. Just don't use Guardian or defender gear as it's designed to be OP in order to get you to Iceborne quicker.

Go fight that bullshit monster again, Oh, and you CAN NOT skip cutscenes, EVEN IF YOU HAVE SEEN IT BEFORE. are you very bad at fighting this ""story boss"" well fuck you, you are tanking the cutscene every time.
""Ok whatever i will just play with friends it should be fun anyway"" First of all, what game is not fun with good friends?? also there is not much of actual cooperation in fights, like sure, you could have someone ""drag aggro"" god knows how and a ""support"" and stuff and try to act like its a mmo raid, but it will never feel like one because 90% of the time you are just smacking the boss and the rest 9% you are doing stuff like healing that generally does not affect other players. Now, you can go out of you way to be a support and help your allies but its mostly buffing, the game is clearly not designed gameplay wise for complex coop, multiplayer is very lacking in general, this is ignoring the HORRIBLE multiplayer system that this game uses, im not even goin to get into it because i have no fucking clue how to make a proper session to play with my friends (in my defense they quit playing so i didn't get many oportunities). I do remember that to do story quest with friends you need to start the quest ALONE, then after finishing the ""wow look at this cool monster, also why is my character brain damaged unskippable cutsceneTM"" only AFTER THAT do you get to ""summon"" your friend... at least its not like in dark souls... also, if for some reason there is a disparity in gear level YOU WILL NOTICE IT. Now this is an EXTREME example but i was about to be done with the first 1/3 of the base game and i was doing a story quest with my friend, and i randomly saw an Odogaron, now i have been trying to farm these but at that moment in time they were about as strong as the stronger enemies I was fighting so i tell my friend if we can kill it (he is not the mission target) so he says yea and you know begins charging a range attack with his gun? bow? idk? and now for more context my friend was deep in the dlc by this point, if i was in 1/3 of the game he was in the 4/3 of it now if you played this game you know where this is going but for the people that haven't, my friend shot the boss that took me about 25 to 30 minutes to kill in previous instances, and just ONESHOT IT... Almost every multiplayer game i have played went like this, less exaggerated, but still, there is no power cap or anything, if you need help you can literally just summon god to do your bidding.  Its... its pretty terrible system, horrible even.

Some enemies are just kind of shit to fight, in the dlc is downright horrible but even some base game monsters also just suck, there are a few that fly for half the fight and SURE you can knock them out and stun them with consumables but this is not the fucking witcher i don't wanna have to come to every boss with perfect equipment, its a hasle and THERE ISN'T EVEN THAT MANY OPTIONS like you would think there would be a special harpoon trap to counter flying monsters or like poisonous caltrops that counter excepcionally fast monsters or anything really, there are TWO TRAPS a bunch of explosive barrels that all do the same thing in different flavour of dAmAgE NuMbErS (how original) poison-paralysis-sleep daggers and, AND WHAT, THE CONSUMABLES THAT YOU ARE FORCED TO CARRY UNLESS YOU WANNA FUCKING DIE? I swear if you told me that there are only 3 more consumables in this game than in the 3ds monster hunter that had Gore Magala i would believe you, its so lacking and boring, also there is no auto restock, you are picking up your fucking 20 items that you used up in the previous hunt manually every single time, even though it would be obscenely easy to add to the game the option to auto restock. also you HAVE TO eat in the canteen or (if you are lucky) inside the camp and the system just kind of sucks balls, if the food is not ""max quality"" you are literally missing 50 hp points, that is like a third of your base hp and you will need to use annoying consumables that if you happen to die in the mission you will have to consume again, like you could say ""well its a monster hunting game where you need to plan around for the hunt"" but its fucking not, you prep like once every 5 hunts because the ""survival"" mechanics of the game either ruin the game or are just there, im not saying that they should remove the hunger bar, that one is fine, you just eat rations but why the fuck are you missing a chunk of your max health, it does not go down as time goes, does not go down as you get hurt, does not go down as you are poisoned either, it only does down WHEN YOU GO DOWN, so now you either gotta eat at camp again or do the MULTIPLE chug of shame, where you need to chug an item that you NEVER want to carry because it has no IN COMBAT effect...WHY IS THIS A THING, Sure im used to it, and everyone and their mother who plays this game probably is too, but every person who is new to the game? holy fuck it sucks balls, the only reason why nobody complains about this is because dealing with it is second nature or you don't get to play the game BUT IT ADDS NOTHING TO IT, ITS NULL, VOID EVEN, fucking remove or rework, there is no reason whatsoever for you to carry max hp restorers in combat, either remove the system entirely or make the player tankier but every now and then you need to ""cure your wounds"" (restore max hp) and only IF you get hit, not the fucking ""oh shit gotta eat at the start of quest and if i don't I basically have the cancer""

holy shit this is a long rant, anyways tldr: shitty farming, shitty multiplayer, shitty enemies, shitty systems, shitty cutscenes, and also most important of all:

I see people play but the great majority seem to have the same issue as me. I'm not sure if CAPCOM is aware, or are too busy prioritizing wilds, or just simply don't care. With their recent posts about returning to WORLD I would assume they'd be aware of this issue. It has been almost a month since this has been happening to me and I don't see any fixing on it.

The Good:
+It's Monster Hunter, it delivers what the title said, no pretentious stuff, hunt monsters threatening the New World you're in now.
+No need to play previous games (in fact you'll be a bit discomforted playing previous games)
+Weapons feel like you play different games 
+Clutch Claw 
+Sword and Shield / Dual Blades 
+Auto Crafting
+Graphics held up well 
+Can run on a potato 30fps
+Very fun alone or together

The Bad:
-No menu style shortcut for the features in town/hub.
-Arbitrarily low item restrictions
-Uncomfortable hot key navigations. Would sticking in shortcut perpetually like most MMOS, Deus Ex, and Minecraft so hard to do?
-Clutch Claw not as easy as one push grappling hook of just cause. Often override the aim button especially if you use ranged weapons 
-Confusing layout of Ancient Forest (the very first world) and Coral Highlands. The others are pretty good at navigation and pathing though.
-Invisible walls putting the illusion of a much bigger world than it actually is
-Story characters posturing but not often taking action together, maybe in one or two missions 
-Handler or somebody else keep pestering you to do the next story mission even if you need to grind for gear
-Voice acting is NOT FULL despite being AAA release and has amazing English and Japanese voice acting.
-Scoutflies often misled you into looting things you don't need 
-No Monster HP Bar (""git gud"" well Dark Souls and Soulslike always have boss hp bar lol)
-Very easy to get stunlocked (git gud then)
-If you play clean (no mods) be prepared for a long fight with no breaks. Even more so if you play Iceborne!

76561198881661657,174960425,"I love MHW! I made the big mistake of using defender set for base game, and so I learned the hard way about the progression mechanics and skill slots :(. Spare yourself that frustration and fall in love with the game from the get go!

Pros: 
-Amazingly pretty game
-Adorable Cat Friend that is your partner throughout all your solo hunts! 
-the experience of falling in love with a weapon type/improving with it (also serves as a intro to the MH community because ""weapon stereotypes"" are always a fun topic of conversation among them).
-Crafting armor sets to min/max and have an amazing sense of fashion. (I was an odogaron set glazer and an edgelord as much as i could be)
-The gameplay/combat has an incredible sense of feedback, not only with how the sound effects/visual effects reflect your strikes on the monster, but also by rewarding you for being smart and taking time to prepare your items, understand your target monster's moveset/patterns, and understand how your weapon of choice works.
-It's also incredible with friends! The experience of going into an elder dragon story mission together with your gang is something you simply cannot replace. The frustration of your friends carting and booting you out of your mission is always well worth it when you finally carve that monster together and talk about who needed to pull their weight haha!
-You can sink a virtually unlimited amount of time into this game. The gameplay at base is simple, but it also has multiple levels of knowledge and skill expression that you can accumulate throughout your time with the game. (it also translates to other games in the franchise very well too!)

Cons:
-Patience and repetition is CORE to this game. You are going to have to hunt the same monster a few times to get the materials to craft the armor/weapon you want from it. While Some may love this aspect of the game, if that is something that you don't like, MHW most definitely isn't the game for you. 
-The combat is not for everyone! I am SPOILED by having Lv 3 stun resist in my decoration slots, because at the start of the game, you will get hit by the monsters a lot. There is a system in the game where if you get hit by the monster enough times, you will enter a dizzy/stunned state upon recovery, making you a sitting duck for a few seconds. That was definitely a factor that dissuaded me and my friends at some points in our experience. (veterans may find this to be a small point, but it did heavily impact how I felt about the game, as well as my peers).
People have cited the combat/movement as slow/clunky, and that's a general consensus that many people come to when they freshly enter Monster hunter. My only comment on this is to give it an opportunity to grow on you! Contrary to what many people have to say about the combat, the decisions that the developers made about the timing and speed of which your hunter moves/does actions are VERY MUCH deliberate. 
-The story is not a strong point of MHW, if an engaging and thought provoking story is something you enjoy in a game, then MHW will more than likely disappoint, this is ALSO coupled with the fact that a VAST majority, if not ALL cutscenes are unskippable. 
-The Defender set. Using the defender set basically puts the base game on easy mode for you, as it is an equipment set specifically used for speeding through the basegame to get to the Iceborn DLC. If you insist of experiencing the full game as it was designed to be experienced/from the best new player experience, PLEASE DON'T MAKE THE SAME MISTAKE I DID, AND DO NOT USE THE DEFENDER SET. 

Overall, I love this game and will continue to whiff my helmbreakers until Wilds :D

Everything about this game has such a great feel and every movement feels so fluid and rewarding. The environments are still breathtaking compared to many games today and are very interact-able that can provide an easier and fun experience when in combat. The monsters all have great move sets that are each unique and different that makes it feel non-repetitive to hunt over and over. The weapons, oh the weapons, each one with a different style to incorporate a different play style that gives players lots of freedom in how one goes about taking down the variety of monsters in fun and enjoyable. The armor sets all have amazing designs that feel worth grinding for just to get that look that looks oh so cool (extreme bias to the Legiana armor). Even on my potato of a computer, the game runs surprisingly well and can even be played offline if you have terrible internet. The only issue I could really conceive is just my horrible luck in drop chances which gets annoying if you hunt a single monster over and over without getting it (also getting into a combo from a monster after a skill issue).

76561198047280319,174908741,"So, i played a bit of this and MH4U before moving to Rise first, just as context. I came back to this game after finishing Rise(mid-lategame), as a bit of a warmup before Wilds drops. I've played up to defeating Kushula Dora(HR).

I think that this is a great game, overall. When compared to Rise, the standout differences are: massively more detailed aesthetics, immersive worldbuilding, and immensely satisfying graphics in/out of combat. Really, it just looks, sounds, and feels so much better to hit monsters in World.

As for the more negative differences, Rise includes massively increased flexibility in combat flow and customization that World doesn't have, as well as more qol for picking up too many items. It also gives players crutches through having palicos *and* palamutes, and adjustable skillsets for both. Basically, it allows for a more fluid gameplan when playing solo. 
Additionally, the aspect of *needing* to equip health boosts(World) instead of just acquiring a peletace(Rise) to increase max HP partially restricts your available build. I would say that defensive stats are valued even more in World, and the ways to acquire those stats are also harder. This adds to the grind of World, even in the midgame, purely from feeling too fragile to fight monsters... This could be a symptom of me being a hammer/longsword player(or just being bad).

The clutch claw(and other tools) allow for very interesting combat interactions, vastly different from wirebug usage. However, wirebugs increase the power level of both offense and defense, giving players a bigger crutch(like how ppl complain about drive rush in SF6). 

The overall aesthetic of the world, monsters, and available gear feel much more grounded than Rise, making those who prefer the specific aesthetic of World love it that much more. Rise, on the other hand, feels more fantasy-esque. 

My other gripes with World include how many systems there are for passive material income. It does allow for a healthy spending of research points(Kamura points' equivalent), but is also kind of a weird hassle to keep remembering all of them and juggling them,

Additionally, I now understand why people who play World complain so much about decorations. Rise has a much more convenient way of acquiring decorations, as you can craft a bunch en masse. In World, you have to instead just randomly get decorations from quests, and synthesize specific decorations through melting down the random decorations that you don't need. This creates another layer of obfuscation and difficulty in acquiring decoration sets(primarily defensive ones) for any situation.

Weapon crafting and upgrades are also designed a *little* weirdly. Compared to the UI of weapon creation in Rise, combining forging *and* upgrading in the same page, they're separated in World, making understanding what you have available to upgrade(or what you want) unclear at a glance.

Finally, although this is probably part of the charm of World, resources aren't just randomly stockpiled to the point that you don't have to think about them too hard. Instead, gathering resources, and more importantly, knowing where to gather resources, is a crucial aspect of the game to know.

So overall, World is quite a good game. It's much more grindy in the early/midgame compared to Rise. The aesthetics and attention to detail are also a 10/10, but the improved graphics bump that up a notch above Rise.
I give it an overall 7.5/10. It's just a personal opinion, and at the very least, I can see why it's a good game, loved by many. It doesn't have the lasting impact for me, but maybe I'm just too much of a zoomer? I just hope that Wilds will combine the best of both World and Rise(which kind of seems like the case?)

76561198144499611,174843011,"Monster Hunter World does a great deal to actualise the childhood dream - what would it be like to fight a dragon? And it absolutely nails the delivery, especially when it comes to the sheer magnitude of size and presence such creatures possess. On top of this it doesn't shy away from the difficulty that fighting such intimidating creatures present and it rewards the smart hunter for diligently preparing themselves before a fight.
The arguably grindy but addictive gameplay loop that Monster Hunter has to offer, will bring you back for more and more even after having played hundreds of hours, and it still manages to surprise you with new angles and strategies for taking on even the smallest of foes. As an experienced hunter, I felt Monster Hunter World hit a nice balance, it has a learning curve that will keep newer players' attention, without overloading them too early, and is challenging enough, come late game, to keep even veteran Hunters excited for more.

Placing you in the shoes of a rookie Hunter in the Fifth Fleet, it is your job to support and protect the research commission in the monolithic task of establishing a foothold among the wilds of the New World and documenting all it has to offer. It is here that the commission begins to discover a strange habit shared among the legendary Elder Dragons. It sees them migrate to The New World once every ten years in an event called the Elders Crossing, a very strange and not well known series of phenomena. Along the way The Fifth Fleet finds themselves following The Elder Dragon Zorah Magdaros in the process of its migration to the New World and decides that this momentous occasion should be documented to better understand the purpose behind such strange behaviours.

The story of Monster Hunter: World isn’t its strongest point, often doing very little to explain the purpose behind hunting each of these monsters other than the broad concept of “researching” them, all while following closely behind Zorah Magdaros through five different ecosystems. I personally never found myself latching onto any of the concepts that Monster Hunter world attempted to explore, instead I found myself more excited to discover which strange creature I would be pitted against next. This resulted in me skipping a large portion of the monotonous text-based dialogue sprinkled throughout hunts. Along with the games, very sporadic and strangely paced cinematics, it seemed more of an obstacle between me and those thrilling fights that put you up against a whole host of memorable monstrosities. This sadly resulted in a forgettable story that I wanted to fall in love with, but found itself falling into mediocrity. Even at the time of writing this review, I’m still ruminating at just how much further the Monster Hunter: World experience could have been elevated by a well thought out story to accompany this supposed labour of love for those who developed it.

Even after hundreds of hours on the clock, Monster Hunter: World still feels really good to play. It isn't hard to see why even now, six years after releasing, and with the imminent release of Monster Hunter: Wilds next year, why so many people are still flocking to experience and even replay Monster Hunter: World. With its easy to learn, yet hard to master systems, giving Hunters the edge over its larger and much deadlier foes, Monster Hunter: World finds a unique depth that isn’t captured by a game anywhere else.
The hardest decision you’ll make during your time in any entry into the Monster Hunter franchise, is figuring out which of the 14 distinctly different weapons you’ll take along with you on your journey. Throughout my time with Monster Hunter: World, I took great joy in managing to learn how to wield 3 out of the 14 total weapons on offer, and even now thousands of hunts later, I can say it only felt like I drew close to mastering 1 of the three weapons I used. This combined with a boastful catalogue of 71 different monsters, after the addition of Iceborne makes Monster Hunter: World a veritable behemoth of a game, without explaining the complexity of its item and armour crafting systems, gem decoration, and 3 world tier systems. If it doesn’t already, the idea of Monster Hunter: World begins to border on daunting when you consider that the experience changes once again when you trade your Palico Companion for other Hunters, should you decide to take this journey on with friends. Astoundingly enough all this information plus more is spoon fed to you throughout your journey in a way that is manageable and makes more sense the longer you stick with it. 

To conclude, Monster Hunter: World is more than a simple game about Hunting Monsters, it’s a genre defying journey that captures an experience that is exclusive only to the Monster Hunter franchise. The minutes quite easily bleed into hours as you find yourself enthralled in its gather, hunt, and craft cycle that effectively makes you feel stronger as you progress. Hunts that once seemed insurmountable, slowly begin to give way and it almost feels like you had found the missing pieces to that puzzle you were struggling with for so long. I can still remember how intimidated I felt when first experiencing each of the base game's regional Apex monsters, only to now compare them to the truly monstrous, Arch Tempered Elder Dragons and I will never forget the challenges that awaited me in Icebornes Master Rank Hunts, challenges that were true testaments to game knowledge and experience. After nearly 300 hours worth of time spent on Monster Hunter: World, I still find myself excited at the prospect of jumping into Monster Hunter: Wilds next year. However, I would just as happily spend another 300 hours in Monster Hunter: World learning one of the other 11 weapons I had yet to play with. I can personally recommend Monster Hunter: World to both new and experienced hunters looking to sink their teeth into a lengthy experience. What you’ll find is both challenging and rewarding, and with how frequently Monster Hunter: World and its expansive Iceborne DLC are available on sale, often with heavy discounts, it’s a no brainer for anyone looking for something fresh and exciting.

Starting out the game gives you the tools "" Defender Gear and Defender Weapon"" to blow through easy and hard, making even the Elder Dragons a walk in the park. My first play through in 2016 it took me and my buddy 30+ times to beat Nergigante. With defender gear we did it first time go this time around. ICEBORNE the defender gear does not carry you. You have to go back to the ABC's and usually your short matts because you didn't have to kill that Rathian 30 plus times for the things you needed.

The Monster designs having inspiration from real life animals, and how the designs are cool and exaggerated, it still have reasons on how it came to be with how they live and the environment affecting the growth of the monsters.
From Big to small to even really smol monsters, getting a proper attention on designs, behavior and everything... 

I can't really say much for the characters, as if you want to look for a unique casts of characters in MH series, MHRise did such a phenomenal work on having unique casts of characters, but there are some characters that i like *cough* Serious handler *cough* and *cough* Guild Girls *cough*... but coming home from a tough hunt to see the warm setup of kitchen of Grandmeowster Chef hits different.. don't hate me on this, cause MHRise is the game where they start to give actual names to the character so that we can get to know them better and differentiate one with another. MHW still sticks to Old Monster Hunter naming system, which we call the people by their proffession. 

Armor is really cool but Weapon are lackluster in terms of designs, Although at first it's cool that it feels a bit ""realistic"" to see bones in the weapon with a bit of part of different monsters, but in the end we be slapping the monster with big fish just cause why not. although MHW:IB (Iceborne DLC) does cover that with how a lot of the weapon have cool designs, and I'm happy for that. but don't let this stop you from getting the game, there's actually still plenty of cool Armors and Weapons designs....

76561198066466657,174710644,"I wanted to give this game a good review, because it is genuinely fun at times. The gear you can craft is cool, the move sets are all great, and it does feel good to take on big monsters with my buddies. However, the one consistent problem this game seems to have is centered around its storyline missions.

The 'Assigned Quests' are the only method to progress to higher levels of the game, and also serve as the storyline for the whole thing while 'officially' introducing the various monsters you then hunt as you progress. The problem is that these monsters are all just as tough in the 'story missions' as they would be if you encountered them in this game's version of free roaming. This means that you will inevitably hit a wall where something two-taps you because you didn't bother keeping all of your gear at the highest level you could possibly hit at the time.

At that point, you've got two options. Option one is to spend hours grinding material for better armor, weapons and support equipment just to clear a single hunt, while option two is to call in a high-level hunter to carry you through with little effort on your part. The first one is frustrating to no end as you constantly have to spend hours gathering materials to craft and upgrade your gear for almost every Assigned Hunt past Normal difficulty, turning the game into a never-ending grind before you've even hit the end-game material. Meanwhile, the second just leaves me feeling like the whole thing is pointless, because at that point *I'm* not the one clearing the content, it's the other player doing it for me. And if that's what it takes to clear the missions and see what happens, then why am I bothering to play the game at all?

All Capcom would have needed to do was dial them back a bit for these story missions (maybe less health, lower defense stats, something) so that it's possible to clear them without feeling like I need to spend hours reworking my entire setup while mastering Dark Souls-level reflexes in order to stand a chance. Instead, I'm left with either beating my head against a wall or asking my buddies to carry my worthless ass because I've grown tired of doing the former.",False,10776,4270,1726029606,1726029606,10,6

76561198064201549,174689274,"Low-mid tier Monster Hunter game alongside with MHGU /sigh

World:Iceborne gave us new things that will prevail over time like no segmented areas, new weapon movesets, some sort of qol (drinking potions while walking, cancel the animation when you're sharpening your weapon), among others. It added a few new monsters to Fanged Wyverns family and great graphical quality at the cost of 666ºc your GPU.

Although It looks nice at first glance, It lacks many things that made MH the way It was until today (Rise:Sunbreak brought back many old features). W:I have RNG decorations and It's a terrible decision; you can't even finish your set because you're tied to your luck even after many hours. Even worse, progressing through the game feels weird since you only have to rely on armours/buying a talisman (not to mention mod mechanic of LBG/HBG). Endgame means looking for Fatalis weapons/armours and that's all (alongside decorations RNG at the Guiding Lands). Monster rooster It's so poor compared to Rise:Sunbreak and 4U, not to mention weapon's design. If you really want to open your eyes, you should look for monster's hp pool on World:Iceborne and compare to past Monster Hunter games (Village and Hub) or Rise:Sunbreak Village and Hub. 

Anyways, If you want to buy a MH game on Steam, I strongly suggest to play Rise:Sunbreak first, then World:Iceborne.

Pros:
- It looks absolutely fantastic, you really do feel like you're in the world itself

- There is a LOT of content in base game, and i strongly recommend getting Iceborne DLC as the storyline AND access to Master Rank make the game even more fun

- Endgame content is satisfying and provides a good challenge

Cons:
- Decorations are RNG; I would a million times rather use a rare item drop as crafting material for a decent decoration. It wasn't like this in the old games and it wasn't like this in Rise.

- I hate the scoutfiles. Paintballing monsters was less tedious... I can see why they were a thing but I feel they are way too distracting. I eventually learned to ignore them altogether.

- I have mixed feelings about the clutch claw. I felt that it was disruptive to the flow of combat and I didn't like the super obvious tell from the monsters that say ""Hey look at me! I'm totally vulnerable and you should clutch claw me right now!"". It's pretty much required to do in Master Rank unless you want to drag out a fight for way longer than it needs to be. What I will admit is that it is way too fun to yeet monsters into a wall or into another monster.

I'd recommend getting the expansion, as I don't think the basegame post-story content is worth the time. Iceborne expansion is really great and cheap when on sales. 

Base game should take about 30-50h depending on how familiar you are with the genre. The expansion should at least double your play time, and I think you'll need more than a 100 hours to get through the base game+extension, and even then there should be more content that may or may not be worthwhile depending on your tastes(deco farming, farming the last monster, trying every weapon, optimizing your builds etc...)",True,33418,33418,1725901873,1736530279,0,0

I can say this is definitely the best in terms of Mechanics and implementation of the favorable environment for hunting.

I tried Rise, but is like playing a spin-off of the Saga Monster Hunter. Too much changes like no Chef for eating before hunt, or the way of mobility is too much, these kind of games has much heavier equipment.

So my verdict for this game is that if you want to start in the saga this is without a doubt one of the best, plus the new game that will be released ""Wilds"" is a successor to this game.

Again not the difficulty of any enemy or something like for real I love DS3 and Elden Ring but this is just torture, btw you cant even change controls for Gamepad and the way movement works makes keybord even with changed controls a pain. If I am missing something and this can all be changed into something playable in the settings pls tell me. For real i dont even get mad while Playing Nioh...

Well after playing more i kind of get used to them but yeah still weird sometimes that everything my character does is in the direction he looks and thats not the same as the cam(You cant change any settings regarding that). But the rst of the Game is great(UI is ok for a 2018 Console-PC port)

76561199550752105,174598780,"My first ever Monster Hunter Game of the franchise. After spending a good amount of time and getting the hang of it, now I understand why it has a massive fanbase. I was already very familiar to MMORPG games, so RNGs as well as loot-and-repeat were no worries.

It cost patience and work to collect unique weapons and armors, though there are basic sets on shop, where's the fun in hunting without elemental effects and flashy armors? There are many weapon to masters, and you CANNOT depending on using one type of weapon; trial and errors, learn and masters, growth (though I'm horrible at other weapons, for now, lol). Then, buying the DLC (Iceborne) was really worth it to extend the replayability, a good investment. The graphic really is beautiful and amazing for six-year-old game, lots of details and feels alive, no pixel breaking nor lagg (mostly on max settings) well at least for me (I game on I7-12th-high, RTX 3060, 16 Gb ram; laptop and plugged all the time).

I feel like this is the type of game that I can revisit and enjoy the same without the slightest difference, as good as the first time. It's an offline game but more fun with co-op. The game for me is really a nice start to Monster Hunter. And last, though the combat feels fluid, the attacks feels clunky (can't redirect attack direction when on combo animation); but I feel like it part of the genre, idk, can't complaint.

Looking forward to Monster Hunter Wilds!

I play a lot of games, mostly multiplayer with a sprinkle of single-player games here and there. I am used to games with pretty fluid movement where you click a button and the action happens instantly and it doesn't wait for previous animation to end. My favorite genre is FPS undoubtedly with CS being my favorite franchise.

[h2] Review [/h2]
Give this game a chance, you won't regret it. Don't treat it as a multiplayer game in your head, the game is a fun single-player experience with the option to co-op (SOS) whenever you need it or want some socializing. I have tried this game twice before with friends where we played multiplayer in all the quests but the game never stuck to me until the third time when I started playing it solo. It is an enjoyable experience going through the story at your own pace. The environment is beautiful to traverse through and hunt. Yes, the movement didn't feel fun when I first touched the game because I was used to faster combat. But with each hunt I got used to it and even though I wasn't perfect it grew on me. This is a game to be played on a big screen and with a controller, with a cup of hot chocolate, sitting on your sofa with a blanket. 

All aboard the MH: Wilds waiting train!

🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟 (5/5) - ""Because nothing screams 'relaxing game' like getting stomped by a fire-breathing dragon for the 73rd time.""  

Welcome to [b]Monster Hunter: World[/b], where you’ll spend 90% of your time chasing monsters the size of skyscrapers and the other 10% wishing you hadn’t. But don’t worry, it’s all worth it when you finally craft that one set of armor that makes you look like a fashionable, medieval Power Ranger.  

[hr]  
[b]Plot:[/b]  
Yeah, there’s a story... something about saving the ecosystem or whatever. But let’s be honest, nobody's here for that. We’re here to bash giant monsters over the head with weapons that make zero sense but look undeniably cool.  

[b]Gameplay:[/b]  
It’s simple, really. You see a monster. The monster sees you. You both proceed to engage in an epic dance of death where one of you is definitely going to need a chiropractor afterward. And, spoiler alert: it’s probably you. But don’t worry, after 5,307 hours, you’ll have mastered the fine art of dodging right into the monster’s attack.  

[b]Graphics:[/b]  
Gorgeous. Absolutely breathtaking. You’ll spend hours marveling at the beautiful landscapes… right before a flying wyvern swoops down and ruins your peaceful nature walk by turning you into a snack.  

[b]Crafting System:[/b]  
Ah, yes. The joy of grinding for hours to gather materials from a monster, only to finally craft a weapon that somehow still isn’t strong enough to defeat the next one. But hey, at least you look cool, right? [i]Fashion is endgame, after all.[/i]  

[b]Co-op:[/b]  
Have friends? Good, because you’ll need them to help you faint three times in under five minutes. But nothing brings people together like collectively screaming at an Elder Dragon while flailing around with oversized weapons.  

[b]Life Lessons:[/b]  
This game has taught me that patience is a virtue. Mostly because you’ll need a lot of it to survive multiple failed hunts and the emotional rollercoaster of farming for rare materials. But the satisfaction of finally taking down a monster after hours of strategizing? Priceless. (Until you realize you need to hunt five more for full armor.)  

[hr]  
[b]Final Verdict:[/b]  
If you love spending hours of your life chasing monsters only to cart back to camp in defeat—and then do it all over again because the loot is so worth it—then [b]Monster Hunter: World[/b] is the game for you. I highly recommend it… if you value monster hunting more than sleep or social life.  

Thanks for reading, and may all your hunts be filled with screaming and slightly successful dodging. Happy hunting! 🐉🎯🔨

This game felt a little bit overwhelming at first since I had to learn every mechanic from the beginning but in my opinion it's beginner friendly enough to let you keep playing even when you barely know what you are doing. Epecially since you get a very OP set of armor and weapons pretty much right from the start. Choosing to play with the ""Defender"" equipment makes the game super easy but that way you get a chance to actually learn the game before it gets more difficult, and still have a chance to make your own equipment in the end-game.

The graphics are great, but perhaps they should have made it a little bit more realistic. The half-realistic half-cartoon style of graphics feel a bit conflicting.

All of the weapons feel distinct and there is very likely one that you will enjoy (Hint: If you think that this game feel ""clunky"" or ""bad"", switch off of the gun lance and onto another weapon, also you can cancel the end lag of a lot of moves with a dodge roll). However, the story is just plain bad, and normally I wouldn't care, since I'm a gameplay > story kinda guy, but it is incredibly intrusive in this game. Unskippable cutscenes, forced walking segments with zero gameplay that last around 10 minuets each, characters constantly telling you what to do, so on and so forth. Also, the number one stupidest thing is that this game thrives in co-op, yet you can't actually play through the story together, since all of the story missions are solo until each person watches all of the cutscenes. Why? I have no idea, it really could not have been that hard to just put more than one person in a cutscene at the same time. Also, most of the fights in this game are great, but a select few (*cough* Zorah Magdaros *cough*) have some of the most mind numbing gameplay of all time. Weapons can also be unintuitive to learn. The game doesn't actually tell you much about the weapon, and some of the attacks aren't even visible in the training range (I have 30 hours on hammer and I just now found out about the clutch claw followup off of a standing max charge). The game kicks into full gear when you hit high rank, which is when the game sort of ""sets you free"" and you aren't as constrained by the story.

The weapon designs are good but could be better as a lot of them feel repetitive especially with the Greatswords but you can easily fix that with mods. The collaborations are really fun too such as with The Witcher and Final Fantasy. The game is endlessly replayable and always a blast. The story is heavily criticised and I agree with most of them however I would make the point that the story DOES work, it may be a bit basic but it helps to tie everything together and the pacing feels right.

76561198208084497,174420200,"I'll start by saying I'm writing this with world being my first MH game, and after logging 250 hours of total playtime across multiple characters, with my most recent character being around MR 165. I first played World shortly after Iceborne released on PS4, and couldn't really get into it at the time. There were a lot of things I didn't understand at the time about the game, or the patience needed to truly enjoy the game. I tried again once I got my PC this past year in December, and while I didn't truly enjoy the game when playing solo, these past few months have allowed me to interact with the community and friends who enjoy the game and series, bringing a new light on what it means to play Monster Hunter.

Some of the chief complaints I see on the steam reviews from as recent as the past 30 days (as of writing this) talk about armor designs, slow combat and gameplay, or the tediousness of not being able to skip cutscenes, not being able to join certain main story quests until after cutscenes from the person who is doing it for the first time, and ill-written story. While the complaints regarding the cutscene skips and quest join settings are understandable, a majority of this is only affected by people playing the game for the very first time, and chooses to largely ignore the overall picture of the game. The story leaves a lot to be desired, but it doesn't really take away from the gameplay other than ""ruining your immersion"" during your initial playthrough.

The general gameplay loop of the game is simple. Gather resources, prep, kill the monster, make better gear, repeat. This game a *lot* of options in it to customize your builds and change the way you fight. While some armorsets and weapons stand out a bit from the rest, you'll be able to constantly improve through the simple act of gathering, prepping, hunting. As you progress you'll encounter bigger and more dangerous monsters that serve as a mark of how strong you really are.

As for combat, the controls might feel extremely slow or clunky for a game that involves fighting monsters when you first start out. The only way I can think of describing the combat system with a simple phrase is, ""opportunistic engagement."" While I am reluctant to make the comparison since the games are two completely different genres, one might see the patience needed to take advantage of certain openings the monster leaves as ""soulslike."" That said, the intensity of this gameplay is much different and more action focused, and you are able to create MANY more opporunities through your weaponskills, the environment, and items in order to lay the monster down into beat town. Having gotten much better at the game since starting, and even watched a few hours worth of speedrunning explanations on youtube, I can happily say that the more you play, the smoother your gameplay will feel. Each weapon is a fine art ready to be refined in it's own unique way, with tricks that might not appear so easily to a first glance. I hope if you do pick up the game, you find a weapon that suits your style, and can make the most of it.

I would encourage anyone interested in the series to give World, and further along, Iceborne, a try. Some of my favorite parts of this game are being able to grapple onto the monster and take advantage of ""tenderizing"" a monster part to deal more damage, and just the amazing music in the background for some of the fights. If I had to list the things I dislike about the game, it would probably amount to there not being any crossplay, and sometimes the servers for the game shit themselves a bit.",True,20984,15112,1725695803,1725695909,0,0

But once you're able to get over the learning curve, learn the mechanics, and you actually get hooked into the game. You'll be in for a very addictive and fun game experience where every $$ worth will be given to you based on the amount of hours you'll put into this game. Base game + Iceborne expansion is a must together, it is very impressive how much content you can get for both base-game + Iceborne.

For me, I have spent about 300 hours in-game which is the most amount of hours I have put into a game since Maplestory. I will consider this to be my number one game despite playing lots of Soulsbourne games, usually I stop at around 100 hours and 200 hours is pushing it but 300 hours is where I feel comfortable enough to write a review about my experience after completing all major bosses (Fatalis included) and for me to recommend it.

I can see people put in about 100 hours for both base game + Iceborne but realistically, I can see it go over 200 hours. There is SO much content and not done in an overwhelming way. The choice of what objectives you want to do is endless, you can stick to one gameplay style or multiple or different types of builds or different ways of approaching monsters. This game can easily get to 1000 hours for me if I wanted to.

Personally, I have always wondered how people can get over 500 hours into this game and it is very easy with how much a satisfying time-sink the game is.

The action-adventure of this game is super unique and very immersive. Handler is best girl, switch-axe main for life, and being carried sometimes is fun aheh.

Overall, if you enjoy action-adventure games with unique mechanics. I think Monster Hunter World with the right tutorials help from friendos as they can help guide through some unwritten rules or help taxi you through unknown information, if you get hooked onto the game, you'll be in for a great ride.

If you can get this on sale, it's 100% worth it. Hopefully you'll be able to enjoy the game like I did, I got super addicted and a big fan of the series now despite this being my first entry. Time to explore other MonHun games.",True,18552,18552,1725686982,1725686982,79,1

I may not be the most experimental player with me mostly preferring long swords and dual blades, but that only scratches the surface for the many options at your disposal ranging from bows, clubs, great swords, and instruments, which is further achieved by the numerous armor options you can obtain throughout your journey. I will say I hate the lack of a skip cut scene option since a LOT of cut scenes are painfully drawn out, so much so that I can prepare food in the interim while they play out. But besides that you will find a community of people that love playing together to take down big monsters with the promise of earning far greater gear, it's the ultimate practice of rewarding players for their hard work and it's truly intoxicating. Monster Hunter: World has character, character that will keep people engaged especially 6 years after it's release, and it's Iceborne expansion perfectly enriches the experience even further.

I was introduced to the Monster Hunter franchise via this game, back when I got my first gaming computer, and played with a few friends who led me through the experience. This game BLEW MY MIND. 
The beautiful environments, incredible monsters, insane weapons (Charge Blade is the coolest weapon in fantasy hands down, a sword and shield that transforms into a chainsaw axe that can deliver a mini nuke of explosions to any monster's skull)
The ecology of it all is wacky and thorough. Everything connects to each other in some weird way, and the environment can be used as your weapon as easily as the sword on your back is. 
Nature is beautiful as I genocide Rathian for her charge blade.

76561198030904505,174304667,"Summary: 8.5/10 - A veteran hunter of the ARPG genre, MH:W and Iceborne finish with a decent track record

The big name of monster hunting games finally came to PC and had a major impact in popularizing this gamestyle. So much so that prior inspired series like Toukiden which came to PC long before it from Omega Force dropped their own unique and beloved niche style and tried to copy it. This led to the horrible failure known as Wild Hearts and the current unknown fate of a once interesting competitor in Toukiden.

With this self-inflicted defeat of their rivals under EAs leadership, the Iceborne expansion offered hunters more of the same and a few new entries - mostly adapted from older game entries in the series. While this is not an issue, the repetitive alternates did leave some things desired and felt lazy at certain aspects. Some of these alternates barely differ from their original with the biggest outlier being Seething Beezlegeuse with its growing napalm mines.

Overall the game has a weird pace. It was made easier with Iceborne to skip the base game and it uses high sharpness and blast weapons (Defender Weapons) for this. This led to many hunters arriving in Iceborne with little knowledge of damage diving or proper evasion and preparation, combined with the new clutch claw feature. Considering the strict difficulty curve of the shorter resting times of monsters and their higher immunity to stuns and other issues, this is a dangerous cocktail. Thankfully many veteran hunters are willing to pick up the slack, leading to most of them still being effectively pulled through the game. This can be a positive and they are allowed to play solo if they want for the challenge. Either way the old feeling of everyone fighting the curve is now over. As long as you don't die, people will even kill Alatreon for you by staying behind in camp or out of danger with their endgame gear. 

For those braving the challenge of doing the story solo and being a true Sapphire Star, the game has many systems to upgrade equipments and later to equip specific gems to plan ahead for each monster or to just build a general resistance gear with Earplugs, Tremor resistance, Stun resistance and Flinch resistance... and blight resistance. Many ignore this one, still.

With the slowly upgrading armor system and augmentation system, former tough challenges of two hits become doable repeated farm battles which often end in grinds for certain sets or weapons. This is one of the main weaknesses of the game, the high requirements for rare drops in many recipes which have to be done in battle or through golden investigations.

Many events change periodically and give extra loot. In the lategame the Steamworks lootbox gives tons of bombs, tranquilizers and healing. In Iceborne much of the preparations of the base game have been made obsolete for good or for worse.

What hasn't changed, base game to Iceborne, is the hitboxes. The monsters still use damage cones, which means even if they don't hit you, if you are on the wrong side of the damage cone and inside of its heigh, you get hit. Stuff you feel shouldn't hit you or not as hard will do exactly that. This especially in Iceborne with the high attack frequency will feel unfair. Something Toukiden strangely did better even back then. You will get used to it, hopefully. To brave this issue you will have tons of weapons to learn and use or you do it like me and only use the Dual Blades, the flashiest of weapons, if heavily nerfed in Iceborne.

The story is decent, nothing to write home about. It's written akin to ""monster of the week"" or rather ""monster of the chapter"" type style with some minor roles given to minor monsters. The main bread and butter of the story are the great cinematic cutscenes with you in the center. Unless you play your story mission in a group, then the group leader is in the center. If you want great screenshots, play them solo first.

The sound design and music is decent, but sometimes feels out of place, even for the Steampunk of this world. While many events have immersion breaking themes and outfits the crossovers are made with care and are really interesting. Especially the FF XIV and Witcher 3 crossover. 

For completionists, you will be long done with everything but the rank grind and to save yourself the pain, the event quests Rotten Canzone (1.5 ranks) and the Circus (0.8 rank) give decent MR for 20-25 and 10-15 minutes respectively. It's still odd that not only is the road to 200 repetitive and boring, the quests to fill out that grind come every 25 ranks and are for one specific item upgrade. The pace is sadly horrible in Iceborne and that will not be changed. The game is finished.

My personal ranking for this game is finish it! Completing it is only for the truly dedicated.",True,45191,45191,1725568487,1725568487,1,0

I may have played so many games which usually boasts of the open world, but nothing comes close to Monster Hunter: World. This game can be very fun and also chaotic at the same time. The adrenaline rush you get when you're chasing monsters or monsters giving you a hard time and you somehow only have one thought which is either fight or flight and this game exactly does that. When you think you will be hunting only one monster in the map, then you're highly wrong. There are other monsters too in the area who can either indirectly help you or will give you a hard time. The turf wars between the monsters makes it even more lively to watch as if you're really in the moment witnessing all the pure chaos. 

Iceborne expansion has some great QoL improvements, but some of the monsters are pretty insane and chaotic! I believe this is what the base game should've been with these features. Regardless it's a great game and I highly recommend it! Can't wait for Monster Hunter Wilds now!!!! And also I want to thank my friend for getting me into this franchise.

I started playing with world when i got it as a birthday present and ever since that really fell in love with the series.


Im gonna start with the cons because its best to know about the downsides before you get sucked in to what makes the game good,

Overall compared to some of the other games that are like it (i.e souls like games) monster hunter world is pretty easy

There was DRM that was added along with the iceborne update that really hinders performance and is against mods (nevertheless the mods proceeded) but it overall was a performance tank to mhw along with its other problems

The story is not really that good as its just mostly go and kill thing, ok cool now that thats done kill different thing (though thats oversimplified)

The Weapon designs for most of base mhw are terrible as they are just some bone weapons or metal ones with a bit of the monsters part attatched and not much else though around endgame iceborne the weapon designs are pretty cool

And Lastly, the game can be seen as very grindy as you have to fight the same monster over and over maby even 5-6 times just to get a full set or a weapon that you want though i find that to tie in well to its gameplay loop (ill get into that later)

Ok on to the pros:

First of all the game looks amazing if you can run it,

2nd, mhw is king for having little interactions all throughout the game that are never really noted and figuring them out is really satisfying like for example, did you know that tsitzi yaku's nest has reflective shells that do actually reflect its flashbang? stuff like this is everywhere and makes the whole world feel alive

3rd the game allows you to be able to see your progress everytime you fight a monster, each and every time you have to re fight a monster you will learn more about their moveset and after every clear of the hunt the next one gets easier than the last and thats simply because your adapting to it and getting more knowledge of the fight.

And lastly, the game is best played with freinds, ive done solo playthroughs and id have to say that being able to hype up your buddies after they get a cool hit in that knocks down the monster, or be able to save somebody from being stunned with an upward swing to being able to combo a monster with 3 other people is a fantastic feeling though not everybody has freinds that can play with them.


To conclude this, monster hunter world is a more freindly souls like game (and i say that really loosly) that encourages coop behavior and allows you and your freinds to overcome challenges together with a kickass soundtrack playing throughout


(side note)

Ive seen a lot of people saying that world is better than rise and rise is better than world, and honestly its just a prefrence to both, world has a more slower paced combat and people might like that, rise has a more arcade feel to it and others perfer that, there both good games its just which one youd perfer.",True,8582,4716,1725403902,1725403902,0,0

My advise is to pick one weapon and stick with it so that you develop an unhealthy bias towards playing that weapon because if you try out a few different ones, you will end up liking a good handful of them. And end up liking other people that use those weapons. And want to hunt with other people and invite new hunters along to try it out. which we don't want. Obviously.

Here's the point I'm trying to make: After all of that time and effort, this late in the game with this much time sunk, I want to finish Fatalis and never play again. I'm honestly rethinking playing Wilds because of how un-fun most of the content has gotten. The grind wall hit harder than any monster, and the meme of killing the difficult monster you're fighting by using the gear of the monster you're fighting actually became real. 

TL;dr this game wants your whole life, your whole attention span, and your whole friend group, and I'm unwilling to give those up.

Pretty good game without Iceborne. But Iceborne elevates it to one of my favorite games of all time.

Sure its kinda grindy and can get repepetitive. But, the variety of weapons negates this. Each weapon feels like a whole new experience. 

Although the real star of the show is the final boss of the game. The last title update. Fatalis. 

Honestly the greatest boss fight in the history of games IMO. Even if you disagree you can't deny its up there at least. Its a long journey to even start fighting him and its extremely difficult. 

But the feeling of activating the dragonpiercer and hearing Proof of a Hero... Then the final hit on him and the quest complete music...

As someone who has played most souls games... It dwarfs the feeling of beating any of those bosses. Its like beating Consort Radahn or Malenia but on steroids. 

That said, i have nearly 100 hours on PC and have only just beat the initial boss of iceborne. I have around 700 - 800 hours on console. 

Its a long journey to fatalis. but its not like its not fun. Initial walls like Anjanath and Nergigante are harrowing experiences. Not on the same level as Fatalis but still amazing. Especially Nergigante. 

Basically, gather a friend or two and start this wonderful game immediately. There's still a large enough playerbase that you can get people to help out. There's even incentives for players to help with particularly hard monsters like the elder dragons. And once you get to siege monsters and Fatalis, you can find lobbies meant to help people do them. There's even LFG discords full of helpful people. 

Its still a long wait for Wilds, but until then we still have this gem to tide us over.",True,5786,5676,1725301570,1725301570,0,0

Is it hard?
Up to you. Till the end credits (of the dlc), the difficulty is more about gearing than the monsters. Every time I hit a wall, I would go farm the correct weapon with the correct gear, farm more to upgrade them all & go back to clear it. But there is an entire game after the credits & that's where skill & planning requirements go up. You can decide if you want to stop when the credits roll. For now I'm planning to stop at MR100 (currently 77).

Can be a bit overwhelming to see all the quest markers when you start but once you get into it it's actually quite simplistic and flexible in the approach you want to take.

One final thing. I played single player till the end of base game. Only tried multiplayer in iceborne. While you can play alone, playing in a group makes everything much more fun. And easier when the monster isn't focused on you all the time. Don't have to be too chatty if you don't want to. A few polite hi hellos and do your own job well is what most people want.

Highly recommended.",True,17316,14629,1725252577,1725300536,0,0

76561198112694877,173965450,"In short, garbage story, clunky combat system, lazy monster designs, ugly weapons & armors designs. It's just not fun. Don't bother.

Oh boys, if you can't do compelling story then just don't. You can just let the players decide on their own as for what to do in the land full of dangerous monsters and unexplored territories. But instead of that, you conjured a garbage half-baked story which, by the way, would have been fine if it were to be optional or multiple side stories that players can discover on their own, and not having everything locked behind it. This makes the game not about ""monster hunting"" anymore. Instead, it becomes 'Oh, we have to save the world so we must kill X.' 'Oh, then kill Y too.' 'Kill Z next!'. Maybe rename it to 'Monster: Mercenary' so it would fit the game play.

Combat system is very terrible. Every action locks you in place, whether it's from a dagger or a hammer. Although, the animations from lighter weapons are faster but that's kinda irrelevant because it locks you in place anyway. You can't really land the last hit of the chain because the time it takes for each swing is ridiculous. And despite being hit by the long-winding-and-buildup heavy-looking swing on the 'weak point', they don't stagger, they fucking won't. But you do and no matter how small the attack is, if you get hit then you'll be on the ground. Hell, you don't even have to get hit, they flap their wings and you are stunned. The element system is kinda pointless, it doesn't do anything, really. Different element is just different color. Fire doesn't burn. Ice doesn't slow. Poison does damage but blast also does damage but in different color. etc. etc.

For a game that call itself 'Monster Hunter', you would expect various kind of monsters. In reality, if they look roughly the same the they are the same. And lots of them look very similar to each other. It's just different skin of the same monster but more aggressive. Same move set but attack more frequent. Even if they're fucking elder dragons, they still have the same moves if they look similar to a low level wyvern.

Armors and weapon are an eyesore. they look nothing like what they actually are. Maybe you can justify that by making them look like they come from parts of monster because they're made form materials from that monster. But that's not the case either. They're just outright ugly.

76561198884315286,173928648,"I'm analyzing this game based on how it compares to the rest of the Monster Hunter series. I'm being slightly bitter, but I do love the game, and I have purchased it and Iceborne both on PC and PS4.

Pros:
- It is the most popular MH game and has the most players online.
- Compared to the previous generation, nearly every aspect of gameplay has been improved upon to feel smother and more accessible.
- The unique tracking mechanic is actually very intuitive and kinda fun to engage with.
- The new armor skill system, the faster weapon movesets, rolling backwards and stepping forwards, the base game's slinger, the item wheel, the added details to the monster field guide, and many more features are very welcome.
- Always having access to: the map, the ability to mark monsters and show gathering points on the map, gathering tools, the canteen, the ability to change equipment and the contents of your item pouch while on the hunt are improvements to the experience. (Hot take: I did not like running out of pickaxes or whetstones.)
- Being able to access all of this on the new expeditions as a former Moga Woods and Everwood enjoyer is extremely nice.
- The endemic life and environmental details set this title apart as the currently best-looking and most interesting to take at a slower pace.
- It has a very active modding scene with awesome people like the Resurgence team bringing entirely new monsters to the game. I wish Capcom would endorse it, but seeing as 80% of the other mods for this game are NSFW, I understand why they don't.

Cons:
- Clutch Claw. I don't like explaining how tenderizing and flinch shots are essential to people who have over 100 hours logged in a game. (I wish the Iceborne Community Edition mod went all the way and just reduced monster HP and removed flinch shots altogether.)
- Guiding Lands? More like Grinding Lands. I am not spending 700 hours to max it out are you kidding me.
- The narrative is a conquistador simulator. Yes, I can capture all the monsters, but I always feel icky hunting Kulve Taroth in the literal caverns of EL DORADO.
- If this is supposed to be an MMO why do most sessions only have 1 or 2 players and no one ever talking to each other?
- Cutscenes blocking multiplayer. Huge step back.
- The monster research segments were poorly executed and came off as frustrating rather than encouraging you to do optional quests and expeditions.
- RIP Greatsword and Hunting Horn.
- For the game to run reasonably well you need to install two mods from Nexus: ""Stracker's Loader"" and ""Performance Booster & Plugin Extender"".
- Many players are not aware that using the Defender weapons and Guardian armor trivializes progression and the learning curve and they fail to improve their skills until much later than expected.
- The tutorialization is annoying and leads most players to ignore crucial details, like how to beat Alatreon and build effective armor sets.

While this game is very good and you will have fun with it if you put in the several hundred hours it asks of you, as all MH games do, Rise has almost all of the features I consider pros and almost none of the cons, so if you're a new player, I actually think you should play that one instead.",True,12224,11302,1725136338,1725136338,0,0

Monster Hunter World is the first game from the Monster Hunter series that I've ever played, and it instantly made me fall in love with the entire Monster Hunter franchise. Since then, I've explored the previous titles like Monster Hunter Generations, MH4 Ultimate, and the more recent MH Rise & Sunbreak. I even delved into the story-rich experiences of MH Stories 1 & 2.

Despite the initial frustration many players, including myself, faced with the unstable multiplayer connections when Iceborne first launched, my love for the game never wavered. Monster Hunter World has a unique charm that makes you feel like a true hunter. It’s not just about the combat; it's about the journey. You embark on thrilling explorations, meticulously track your prey, and gather clues until you finally encounter the monster that is your main quest target. This immersive gameplay loop is what sets it apart from other games and keeps you coming back for more.

MHW is a brilliant masterpiece that excels in every aspect. The environments are stunning, each area meticulously crafted to feel alive and dynamic. From the lush greenery and towering canopies of the Ancient Forest to the desolate, foreboding beauty of the Rotten Vale, every location tells its own story. And who can forget the breathtaking sunsets over the Ancient Forest, where the sky is painted in hues of orange and pink, adding a layer of serene beauty to the savage wilderness?

The game's attention to detail is unparalleled. The sound of your footsteps crunching through snow, the roar of a distant monster echoing through the trees, or the simple yet captivating act of setting up camp – everything is designed to draw you deeper into this world. Every hunt feels personal, every battle a test of skill and strategy, and every victory a hard-earned triumph.

For anyone who loves action RPGs, Monster Hunter World is an absolute must-play. It’s not just a game; it’s an experience that captures the thrill of the hunt in a way no other game does. If you’re ready to immerse yourself in a world where every hunt is an adventure and every monster a challenge, then this is the game for you.

76561199229292553,173911905,"This a fun game about abusing monsters, doing quests about abusing monsters, and making sick armor and weaponry from their remains. 

I bought the game with the Iceborne DLC, and at first, I wasn't so sure on this game. Some friends told me to play it with them, and so I did. Slowly after a couple play sessions, I really liked the game. I even went and bought some more gesture packs and stuff so my friends and I could troll each other. 

The designs, sound tracks, and animations of each monster and creature in the world makes the fights and random creatures you encounter feel great. Like each battle was grand and important. Plus, the dynamics change if you have teammates, whether it be friends or random people. On top of that, the dynamics change even more based on everyone's weapon choice. I'm personally a fan of the insect glaive and bow genre of weapons in this game. However, people can pick up really annoying weapons to fight along side. My friends and I had a joke for every time we saw people we would help out with those weapons. Of course, use what you want, I don't care, it's just, we always had bad experiences with players who used certain weapons such as longsword. 

If you're picking up this game, I'd advise to stick strictly to yourself and the friends you may play this game with. If you have none, you can try joining random people on expeditions or who need help in certain quests. As some quests feel like you'd really want at least a single teammate on and other feel best alone, then rarely some feel like you'd want as many friends as possible. The more people, the more likely everyone is to get in the way of each other. But, if you have enough communication and experience with each other and your tools, then it can be more than fantastic. 

The armor and weapons all (from what I can tell) look beautiful. I personally had a goal set for both my insect glaive and bow category, getting every weapon in whatever tree I choose and adding as many to my collection as possible. Same with armor, I never sold any armor. However, with Iceborne DLC, I have a few complaints about the armor. You can make whatever armor you can afford really, but the ""skin"" types of armor (I forget what the cosmetic armor that goes over your actual armor is called) can only be used at the end of the game. After I already did everything, then you're allowing me to look the way I want? Brother, I'm done with the game! There's nothing else! Well, okay, not entirely true, I didn't do EVERYTHING the game had to offer. However, when something popped up like a quest I wanted to do or a certain monster I wanted to fight, or an event that appeared; I did them! I don't want to do anymore when I'm already done with the game. Plus, the game is a constant battle against harder and harder to beat enemies, which is to be expected. But, to get the newest and best armor you can now get after unlocking the newest monster, you can rather be grinding or give yourself a difficult time of denying that you need new armor when you clearly do. 

The little bugs and creatures you could catch with the nets are a fun little distraction here and there. Plus, all the different designed houses you get to see and experience for free is pleasant. The amount of customization with your character, your cat friend, the creatures in your house, and more, it's great. The Argos and the botanical research guys (ngl I completely forgot if that either of their names lmao, I mean the ship that sells you stuff and the place where you can plant stuff for them to supply you that stuff) either way, they're super helpful and are basically needed to get a surplus of materials to craft and use against monsters. Plus, buy things when an event happens, things get an extreme price cut. I used the bow and constantly had more than enough special types of arrows while spending practically nothing on them, plus purchasing explosive barrels and traps to always stay supplied up.

Overall though, the game is fantastic, especially for someone like myself who was blind to the upcoming monsters and saw their designs and special battles for the first time when meeting them. It felt grandiose and epic when fighting giant monsters like Vaal Hazak and Legiana for the first time with friends. Now, battling them for fun is nice, but they're not as cool as seeing them and finding out how to slay them for the first time.",True,10362,10362,1725121687,1725121687,0,0

76561198070400412,173839477,"Let's be real. If you’re a dual blades player in Monster Hunter World, Kushala Daora is basically your nightmare incarnate. For the uninitiated, Kushala Daora is an Elder Dragon with that all-too-familiar metal armor and wind manipulation. Sounds cool, right? Wrong. For dual blades users, it’s a whole different story of frustration and agony. First off, let's talk about mobility. Dual blades are all about speed and relentless attacks. You dash in, you dash out, and you keep up the pressure. But Kushala Daora doesn’t play by the rules of fair fights. This dragon, with its obnoxious wind shield, makes landing hits an exercise in futility. Every time you get close, it unleashes a gust that pushes you back, disrupts your attacks, and generally makes you feel like you’re trying to dance in a hurricane. Those gusts aren’t just annoying; they’re practically a slap in the face to your entire playstyle. And let’s not even get started on its ability to make the fight feel like it’s taking place in a wind tunnel. You’re constantly being blown away, making it nearly impossible to keep up your DPS. The wind isn’t just an inconvenience; it’s a full-on barrier against your attacks. Your dual blades, which are supposed to be about rapid strikes and keeping the monster’s attention, are rendered nearly useless because you’re always being pushed out of range or staggered mid-combo. Then there’s the issue of Kushala Daora’s frequent positioning shifts. It seems like every time you get close and start laying into it, it decides to fly away to a different area. This is particularly grating for dual blades users who thrive on close-quarters combat. You’re constantly chasing it down, wasting time and stamina, and getting more and more frustrated as it lands in a different spot and immediately starts setting up its wind shield again. It’s a constant game of cat and mouse where you’re always the mouse, and it’s not fun. The wind shield isn’t just a nuisance; it’s a full-blown disaster for your strategy. If you’re trying to focus on exploiting weak points or hitting specific damage zones, the wind shield makes it nearly impossible. You’ll find yourself constantly waiting for the shield to drop, which it does only rarely and unpredictably. And while you’re waiting, you’re still being pushed around and thrown off your rhythm. It’s like playing a game where the rules keep changing just to spite you. Kushala Daora’s moveset itself doesn’t do dual blades players any favors either. Its attacks are designed to keep you at a distance, which is the exact opposite of what you want as a dual blades user. You need to be close to deal damage, but Kushala Daora’s attacks are constantly pushing you away or knocking you down. This makes it incredibly hard to maintain the aggressive, high-risk-high-reward playstyle that dual blades excel at. Instead, you’re stuck playing a defensive game, which is the last thing you want when you’re using a weapon designed for all-out offense. Let’s also not forget about the added difficulty of its status effects. Kushala Daora’s ability to inflict wind pressure, which causes you to get knocked back and stagger, is another layer of irritation. It’s not just the wind shield you have to worry about; it’s the constant interruptions that make it nearly impossible to build up your attacks or perform your signature moves. It’s like fighting a monster that’s specifically designed to ruin your day. Kushala Daora feels like it was tailor-made to make dual blades players’ lives miserable. It’s a monster that counters the very essence of what dual blades stand for. Instead, you’re stuck in a constant battle against wind, positioning, and status effects, making what should be a high-energy fight into an exhausting slog. So there you have it. Kushala Daora is, without a doubt, the worst monster for dual blades players in Monster Hunter World. The wind shield, the constant repositioning, the disruptive attacks, and the status effects all combine to create a frustrating and demoralizing experience. It’s a fight that feels rigged against your playstyle, turning what should be a thrilling hunt into a grueling test of patience and persistence.",True,20555,7107,1725052220,1725052220,1,0

The monster and land designs are beautiful with detailed textures. Even though I'm still in the early stages of MH, the thing that has bothered me the most is the land itself. Sometimes i will find myself walking in circles or whatnot, although I'm not sure where I'm trying to get at here. I most enjoy the different kinds of monsters and their mostly different attacks. Another thing i also enjoy are the armors, but that's because i have a knack for really cool fantasy armor :) Love this game, and i definitely would recommend it to others.

I suppose I could return to an old save, but I'd like to play through from the beginning. Unfortunately doing this, well, it just annoys me. Why did they make the story so prominent? Not only is it terrible and uninteresting but it is forced upon you. You are forced to sit through and watch terrible (unskippable) cutscenes, walk through mandatory walking segments while NPCs exposition dump, play dull tutorial missions, interact with a million story NPCS, and then get to watch even more cutscenes if you ever dare to start a new save. Want to get into the thick of it, and hunt monsters? Well too bad. 
And don't worry, this doesn't stop at the later stages of the game, unskippable cutscenes all the way through! We all know the best bit about Monster Hunter is the story!

Relative to the other games, the combat is no better, the graphics are more modern, and the music is fine, so unless you're incapable of enjoying a game because it looks old, just play one of the other games. Why bother experiencing this version of the game when you could play literally any other monster hunter. Play one of the games that allow you to skip through all the story (which is minimal in those games anyway) and just get straight into the monster hunting. 

I managed to play through the base game once, with a friend. Had I played solo I wouldn't have bothered. 
Really only once you have beaten the game are you free from the cutscene menace. Which once again just begs the question, why bother with beating the game when you can just play any other game from the series and be free from cutscenes immediately.

That person was wrong. I'm so f ucking bored. I feel like since I'm coming from DD2, I've played a much better, streamlined version of this that had companions, faster combat and a more lived-in world. 

Things I Like: 
+ I got this for free as my first game that came with my graphics card! 
+ Character customisation and cat slave customisation is ok (no where near as detailed as Dragons Dogma 2, but you can make a nice looking character.) 
+ If you hate animals, this the game for you, you little freak. 
+ The bigger monsters in the game. 

Things I Dislike: 
- Having to replay the first hour after a random crash, to find the cutscenes are unskippable and another hour of my life has gone by before I was allowed to do anything. 
- You get one free token to edit your character and then you have to pay. I didnt have to edit my character, I just hate that Capcom f ucking loves creating an issue and selling you the solution. I guess no one complained about it here, so they went nuts with it in DD2. 
- Selecting the Steam Store option in-game immediately puts the game in your Steam cart. What the actual fuckatony is up with that? 
- The game is £25. The DLC is somehow £35. The soundtrack is £20??? Here's a link to listen to the soundtrack to free on Youtube because price gouging goes brrrrr: https://youtu.be/-yEL0ZrpzE8?feature=shared 
- Massive weapons and armour that weighs nothing. I'm coming from other fantasy medieval games, I know it's just for fun, but it looks fucking stupid to me when there's a scene with people in full plate, under the sun, labouring. 
- Ironically, the game with weightlessness has slower combat compared to DD2. This is the cherry on top: When I finally got through the intro hour, the combat was boring. 
- NPCs talking to me like NPCs and not characters in a world: ""We need your help! A monster has our people trapped! Press Select to open the map and place a marker on their location! Quickly!!!"" 
- Yeah the customisation isn't as good as DD2 but there's also things like lowering or raising the visor on plate helmets that I wish was done here too. I aint fighting raptors with my face exposed. 
- This is one of those games where the women cant wear some of the same armour as the men without exposing their thighs or something. This is a reference to how men always confuse other men with women, I guess, idfk",False,250,194,1724878204,1725172338,0,1

The world feels alive and connected. It still holds up visually with the texture pack, and the designs on a lot of the monsters are just so cool. 

The combat feels weighty, in a good way. You have some comically large weapons, and they often feel like it, too. Impact on the weapons feels great. It took a bit of getting used to, but after starting off with dual blades to get a feel for the slower combat with most weapons, and often just in general. I'm now very much enjoying my time playing with more complex, and/or slower weapons. 

The UI and menus kinda suck, though. 

Worth it at full prices and an absolute bargain on a discount. 

Highly recommend.

Monster Hunter is a difficult game, but it's punishing but fair, so if you pay attention, you can win the day, and if you attack monsters without paying attention, it will humble you with extreme prejudice!

76561198173409875,173180188,"It all starts when you create a character whose face only a mother could love. You're then greeted by a menu system unlike any you've ever seen before (it will take some time to get used to). Meet characters you'll only interact with for the first 2 hours of gameplay before you start skipping all their dialogue BUT, looking past these slight inconveniences your first real fight awaits you: Great Jagras.

You manage to slay the beast after a fierce (and somewhat button-mashey battle) only to realize that this was just the first monster out of about 70 give or take, all of which will force you to interact with the game systems in new and interesting ways. Some will force you to target specific parts of their body to deal any meaningful damage, some will inflict you with status effects which you need to counter with specific items and some more will use and even form their environment to their advantage. On top of this, monsters sometimes fight eachother. You might be hunting one monster only to be absolutely demolished by another just running or flying right into your battle. As you might guess: fighting two monsters at once is difficult, but the game gives you options which allow you to shoo one of them away.

During your adventure where you hunt these unknown monsters you will get better and better at interacting with the game's systems and most importantly, using your weapon. This game nails the feeling of mastery like no other, just like all the Monster Hunter games do really. Getting really precise parries or dodges and launching devastating counterattacks just feels so incredibly satisfying. Not to mention that there are several different ways to damage monsters, including using the environment and several gadgets and consumables you acquire along the way.

To add on top of this: the game features multiplayer AND your actions can actually interact with your teammates. Hitting someone might cause them to trip, depending on the weapon you can even hit someones shield to enable them to use a counterattack which then hits the monster you're hunting. This isn't a system you will interact with all that much but if you want to enjoy the game to the fullest I highly advise you play some multiplayer, either with randoms or preferably friends.

The game can get rather difficult, especially once you get into the Iceborne expansion. It's never difficult enough as to get frustrating but if you're into difficult games you can absolutely get your fill later on into the story. If you just want to slap giant monsters around: the game has systems in place which allow you to somewhat control difficulty (with crafting certain armor pieces and weapons), so you should be fine.

You cannot write a review of a Monster Hunter game without mentioning the incredible work that Capcom has put into the ecology of the monsters. Not only are there extensive field guide entries and wiki data on how the different monsters interact with their respective ecosystems, you can also see it first hand. You'll be able to find tracks, tufts of hair, mucus, carcasses and much more when out on a hunt which point you towards what kind of monsters might be lurking around. The game directly tells you which monster it is once you've investigated that particular monster enough, but you can also see what monster it is purely based on the textures of these different tracks you find.

Some monsters even form the environment around them to suit them. This does not stop at building nests or forging paths through the forest. They might incorporate toxic parts of the nature around them into their attacks, they might create tunnels or burrows which allow them to use their specific modes of attack more effectively and so on. This is most apparent in the Rotten Vale, where more than half the map is formed by one specific monster. 

As you might see, I can go on and on about why this game is great (don't even mention the soundtrack. Look up ""Bazelgeuse theme"" on You Tube), given it has it's flaws. I'll list a few so you don't think I'm too biased:

-Unorthodox and sometimes irritating menu systems, especially the inventory.
-The clutch claw (an item you'll be using every hunt) has some trouble hitting regularly, and it's range is a bit weird.
-Drop rates which sometimes force you to fight the same monster more than a couple of times to actually get what you need (somewhat offset by melding later in the game)
-Monster pathing can sometimes force you to run around way more than you actually want to, especially when you don't know enough about a monster to be able to track it in real time.

76561199250777574,173071257,"As my entry point to the Monster Hunter series. This. Was. AWESOME! And this game is quite good and stable in 2024, sure rarely a monster's AI might have a breakdown in the middle of a hunt, or you get booted from your current lobby at random, but other than that I think I've only ever experienced 2 or 3 bugs. 

I managed to snag the digital deluxe edition of Iceborne after receiving a gift card for Steam and was kind of skeptical at first. I was looking for a game that had slow, deep and methodical combat as I wanted to take a break from more fast paced combat. And after some troubles understanding the system at first (cause I chose Charge Blade as starter weapon), boy, did it DELIVER! You really feel every big hit, especially a weapon's ""ultimate"" move like TCS, Helmbreaker (They should really rename this tailsplitter to point out where longsword players are supposed to aim), Wyvernfire, SAED, ZSD, or doing the golf swing and knocking out the monster on hammer. Also landing counters is really satisfying, especially when you learn a monster's entire moveset and know how to react to each one of them.

Another thing that might go overlooked is the deep ecology of the monsters, they don't just have abilities for the heck of it there is an ecological reason as to why a monster has a certain ability. And the turf wars are great! When they're unique at least (*cough cough and flying wyvern in Iceborne cough cough). I know this game is considered ""easier"" than past entries in the series, but I don't think players can deny that some of the game play changes have made hunting more enjoyable, except for the clutch claw. That thing is broken and I'm glad it's not making a return in Wilds.

Probably my biggest beef for this title though would be if you're looking to progress through the story of this game with a friend, then have fun watching cut-scenes twice. I don't know why Capcom decided that that's the method for determining what type of hunts players can do together, but they did. Poor decision on that front. Oh and also I wonder if the next handler will not be an Idiot who favorite saying is ""When in doubt. Take a bite.""

Finally for any prospect player this game is very much a ""you might not like it at the start but just hold out. It'll click eventually"" and also it's not for everyone. But the people it is for, welcome to the point of no return, you can kiss 100s maybe even 1000+ hours bye bye, cause that's what this series does to you.

76561198013028771,173066118,"TLDR: [b]It starts slightly slow and rough, but grows on you. Offers a semi-relaxed to intense boss fight kind of experience with decent variety and a very alive feeling ecosphere.[/b] 
Edited/updated with more player experience:
Trying MHW for the 1st time, having played dauntless with friends several years ago.
1st impression: [b]MHW Combat is... rough. PS1-era rough. But it does improve.[/b] Weapon aim is bad/terrible, slightly over direction locked but no real target lock. In the training area, I tried every single starter weapon & struggled to hit a barrel in front of me! [b]this improves significantly in actual gameplay. Your targets are very large[/b]
I started with sword and shield, thinking initially the mobility + dodge would feel most familiar. (and ppl recommend it) But it was the opposite. It was a constant reminder of the bad aspects of the game's combat / how much it doesn't feel like most crisp hack-n-slashers. [b] Before I watched a video and changed how I played, tt felt more like monster-moshpit than combat.[/b]
Even with that poor beginner combat experience and a very slow start before it opens up and lets to do stuff - the hunting, the way world feels very alive, and exploration matters the chasing down the hunt quickly grows to a fun experience that keeps building & you end playing for longer than you should.
And having watched how to combat video, I switched to the incredibly mobile insect glaive & had a significantly better combat experience. (hint: you aren't meant to be in a boxing match with a t-rex, and you need to know a few higher damage combos for your weapon) 

The world definitely feels more serious & feels like it looks better, even if it's ps3 era graphics on steroids.

[b]Dauntless (from several years ago): has fluid crisp visceral combat.[/b] YOU did something. YOU failed to dodge - ouch! You got too greedy with attacks ignoring warning signs? Wham. You score a heavy hit breaking a part? Explosion, monster crumples for a bit, everyone dog piles to lay down damage with impunity. YOU need to blow that part off to get the material you need. Teamwork and clutch saving each other galore. It's very engaging. It's the COD:MW of the monster hunting genre.
But Dauntless levels just start to feel like arenas and the game gets a bit same-ie after a while. Graphics wise, it's cartoonish. The monsters are great, but all the locations feel like arenas (albeit shaped arenas, but not a world). Multiple weapon types were very satisfying to me and definitely cater to different play styles. Different bosses encouraged having a few favorites (there wasn't the ability to carry 2 weapons back then). Honestly, the only bad weapon was guns, because the playstyle was boring.

In comparison, I see myself flat out not liking several of the monster hunter weapons. It definitely changes how you play vs traditional hack-n-slashes. And that very much changes how you expect weapons to behave. They do a few cool things, different kinds of mounting monsters, cutting and bashing parts off, etc. (glaives when you mount a monster can cartwheel damage). Overall, they are decent - but none of them feel as dramatic as Dauntless. Perhaps they gain a little back for feeling more earned, but overall just less feedback in combat.

In Dauntless: One of my favorite things was building up a full lance charge blast, then waiting for the owlbear to try to do it's flying swoop. Timing, don't miss, nailed it! Boom, the owlbear is stunned mid-flight, instead of swooping, it slams face 1st into the ground tearing up a furrow like a crashing shuttle. Dog pile. You feel great for the team and get instant visceral feedback for your actions.

[b]MHW will never give that intense a moment.[/b] It will never have that clutch team save or feel as engaging in combat as dauntless in it's good moments. [b]But it offers an experience that is overall a more stable fun and is a far less stressful game.[/b] Because its experience is not just arena after arena, I expect the average person will have far less burnout than dauntless too. You can kinda choose to wander around doing things casual, or aggressively go after fights, even go after fights that will push you.

MHW delivers shocking moments like monsters that actually have behaviors and habits. A great MH moment is when you are fighting a rock behemoth that you are wondering if you will quite manage to beat on your own... but then a giant fish-snake happens to wander by. A giant fish-snake that as a species shares a mutual hatred with rock behemoths (due to territorial disputes) So unlike some other beasts that could have wondered by, they immediately ignore you to go all in on each other. Giant fish-snake suddenly wraps around the rock beast's body several times and starts death-rolling it.
After a quick monster piece ripping bout, the fish runs off, leaving a limping rock beast ready for you to finish off.

Another good? moment, fighting a chimera-like birdsnake. slowly but steadily beating it. Rex thumps it's way up, hurts it a bit and the bird-snake runs off. Ok I'll try fighting a rex. Chomp! Oh! that was 1/3 of my health! run run run, hide hide hide...
Now I sneak my way back the to bird snake, but I have to take a couple detours, because that rex just happens to be perusing right where I need to cross.

I won't spoil some of the 1st encounter moments, but they are great.

I reviewed solo. Should you get this to play with a friend? Yes, you'll enjoy that. But I wish they didn't have the cutscene restriction. It won't feel like a co-op campaign like most games, it's going to feel more like an open world game, but playing with people is nice. They also have a flare system that invites random players (you can set restrictions) so that helps in tough fights, or you can join other's flares. Plus you can host or join a townhub instance that other players can be in. anyone there can see when someone posts a mission and join or do their own thing as they please.

76561198162298288,172905300,One of my first entries into the MH series and it did not disappoint. I played on release and it was one of the best experiences i've had in gaming. Fond memories of playing with my friends and tackling the challenges in the game solo or in a group. The story was alright but the bread and butter are all the fights and weapons along with how many builds you can go in the game with any weapon. This is one of my favorite games to date and to this day since release I still play the game clocking in over 1200 hours in the game. If you haven't gone on this wild ride of a game i 100% recommend giving the game a shot.

Of course, receiving it for free did not alter my opinion of it, but I do have to say it is quite funny to me how most of the game is locked behind an expansion that costs more than the game itself. 
Monster Hunter World is a game where you... hunt monsters. With oversized goofy weapons that have no business being effortlessly swung around by the hunters, this game really surprises me with how over-the-top it really is, but in gameplay it feels incredibly solid. Save some ""bullshit"" hitboxes occasionally, it really is a wonderfully crafted game that makes you feel that, despite the size difference, with enough skill you can become an apex predator yourself, but turn into a helpless prey the instant you grow complacent.

76561198357356001,172887884,"I rly wanted to like this game but tbh I just couldn't sadly. It's a good game don't get me wrong, but there are just alot of annoyances that, while small, when added together just ruin the game for me. I think the main thing is just how clunky everything feels. Like in order to enter combat you have to press the attack button then start attacking, simple right? The problem is that when you're in the attack mode you can't sprint or use items. Let's say you're low on health and need to use a healing potion, you have to sheith your weapon (which depending on your chosen weapon can take a short or long amount of time) select your healing potion using either a radial menu or scrolling through all your items till you select the healing potion, then you need to press the use key in order to start drinking the potion but it doesn't instantly heal you bur instead plays a long animation while it heals you to the specified amount (bearing in mind that if this animation gets interrupted by any means your healing will be cut off and you'll have to drink another potion). On paper this doesn't sound too bad, but keep in mind the game doesn't pause while your doing this, meaning you have to do all this whilst also being damaged and knocked around by the monster your hunting. Bear in mind you also have to go through a similar process to keep your weapon sharpness up as well as when trapping monster and it gets frustrating fast. But what's more frustrating is the fact that monsters will flee like to the other side of the map when your trying to hunt them and the fact that they can also de spawn when ever they feel like it and it's just not that fun. Especially seen as how some of these monsters seem to have huge amounts of health and if they get too far away from you, you have to sheith your weapon, run up to them and un sheith your weapon and then keep attacking, that is unless they don't stun lock you and then kill you first. Another thing that makes the combat painful is the lock on system. Instead of your character tracking the monster it's just your camera that tracks it, meaning you have to manually adjust where your character is facing in order to get some hits in. The issue with this is that you have to commit to every attack you do, meaning that if the monster moves whilst you're performing a combo you'll be stuck there swinging at nothing until you have to re-ajust your position or the monster knocks you down with an attack. I really wanted to like this game, it's got a good story, great gameplay loop of hunting monsters to get material to upgrade your gear and the environments and monsters are all gorgeously well designed, it's just that the controlls and mechanics feel clunky and slow whereas the gameplay feels like it wants you to be fast paced and quick which to me just doesn't feel possible with the mechanics and controls which is a bumper cos I've always like the idea of the monster hunter games",False,349,349,1724275612,1724275612,3,5

there is an element of exploration to some degree but dont expect it to be akin to Breath of the Wild or the likes; the exploration is much less interesting

if you like fighting big monsters and boss battles then this might be the game for you, BUT BEWARE IF YOU EXPECT IT TO FEEL LIKE EASIER DARK SOULS! (like i did). the combat is quite different from Souls-like games - there is indeed rolling etc and utilizing different moves of different weapons; however, there is a lot of emphasis on combos - you cannot do every move right out of the box, in many cases you need to perform a certain move so that you can do a different move (the second can be done only in a sequence with the first), whereas in Souls-likes generally you can perform most moves as standalones,
this makes the combat in Monster Hunter a little more about your own moves, a little less about the boss moves IMO. also the fact that you need to combo moves made me feel like I had a bit less agency in the game vs Souls-like games

it also can get grindy but it is definitely not required, at least not at the point in game where i did get; performing (repeatable) quests to get certain items required to craft better weapons/armor just feels nice in this game",True,5799,3747,1724263617,1736642436,0,0

Worlds is among the most immersive mon hun experiences by far and plays very smoothly.

It is incredibly full of depth and is very fulfilling once it clicks. 

Many kind of incorrectly compare this series to dark souls, and while yes there are similarities like difficulty and such. It is a VERY different game, and unique only to itself.

76561198066356635,172475776,"This game is like crack cocaine. 
While it can be overwhelming for new players at the start, once you get into it it is incredibly addictive. Though I struggle to decide on whether it's because the game is actually any good or not, or if the core gameplay loop is just that addictive. 

The concept of fighting giant monsters that give you access to materials, that you can use to craft better gear, that in turn lets you hunt bigger monsters, is just an incredibly solid foundation for an addictive game. On top of that the game has some incredible charm, whether it be the ridiculously sized weapons you use or the cat companions that help you out.

The game does however have some major flaws that I hope gets addressed in the upcoming sequel. 

For one, coop is a bit disappointing. Especially since the functionality for it is built into the game and works completely fine for side content, and the game is a lot of fun to play with friends. Which is why it's so baffling that for some reason it doesn't extend to the main story of the game. 
It is practically impossible to play through the main story missions together with a friend. One of you has to have already completed the quest to be able to join it, and even then you can only join the very end of the quest since you can't join before all of the cutscenes have played, for some reason.
I genuinely don't understand why they have made it this way since coop works just fine when playing side content, why not allow people to play the main story missions together as well?

Additionally the combat has some flaws. It's made up for by sheer cool factor, the weapons are all incredibly unique and the monster audio-visual designs are great. That being said the longer you play, the more frustrating the sluggish feel of the combat can get. This isn't due to poor performance or optimisation, the game runs smoothly and the hitboxes are spot on. But there are several design decisions that can make the game unnecessarily frustrating. 

For example there is no animation cancelling, which is odd since the combat is based around combos. Practically every third person action game that has its combat revolving around combos have animation cancelling. What's worse is that there isn't any direction cancelling either. If you attack in a certain direction the rest of you attacks in that attack string will go in the exact same direction, unless you stop attacking, move your character, and then attack again. This can't even be solved by dodging, if you attack to the left, dodge forwards, and attack again, the second attack will go to the left. Unless you stop after dodging and move forwards.

Additionally I was left dumbfounded when I read the description of an item piece that said that it ""prolonged invincibility frames while dodging"" and I went ""oh, there's i-frames in this game?"". Before reading that item description, if someone had pointed a gun to my head and asked ""are there i-frames in MH World?"" I would have looked them in the eye and without a seconds doubt said ""no, there are no i-frames in MH World"". Apparently there is, though you will likely never notice it while playing. I have no idea how slim the dodge window is, but it must be incredibly small. Noticeably smaller than games like Dark Souls and Elden Ring. I genuinely thought it was a stylistic choice to make you have to dodge based on direction rather than based on timing.

Overall the game is worth whatever it costs on any given day, especially if it's on sale. It's great, not bad in any way, just frustrating. Why is the coop designed the way it is? And why is the combat so sluggish? Hopefully these issues while be addressed in the upcoming sequel.",True,6439,2059,1724095017,1724095017,0,0

76561198039514221,172430999,"I'm writing this review from the eyes of someone with little prior experience in the monster Hunter series who came into the title late and with limited friends to co-op with on my first playthrough. I mostly solod the game as if it was a purely single player experience though I took advantage of the SoS system from time to time. I would later play it again with my fiancee and daughter who are both hooked.
Overall score: 9/10

Gameplay: 9/10
      Takes some learning but the game is fairly generous with the difficulty curve until a certain boss skill checks you hard a couple of hours in (a necessary and not particularly difficult fight if you actually dodge). If you've ever played a souls like game you'll be at home with the basic play style. Your goal is to kill the thing before it kills you. Every attack can be dodged and learning enemy patterns and weaknesses is pretty important. it is no where near as difficult as a souls game but it is every bit as complex. Every weapon type has a completely different playstyle and takes hours of game play to master. I mostly played Insect glaive and bow. Weapon and armor sets are pretty varied and the stat system is easy enough to understand. Most of what you'll be doing is accepting missions/quests then going out into the world to hunt the thing, which may or may not be 25 feet tall and breath fire. The rest of the time will be spent crafting items, gathering resources, and building a gear set for the boss you want to fight.

Story: 8/10
     You are a member of the last wave of reinforcements to a newly discovered continent in the monster hunter universe allowing for the game to be a sort of soft reboot of the series. The story has a heavy emphasis on exploring and studying this country while defending your fledgling civilization from the big bad killing machines. From establishing camps and hunting dangerous creatures to finding missing people and trying to solve the overarching mystery of the giant walking volcano the story takes you across a wide variety of environments and settings with characters that are interesting enough. Most NPCs exist to give you your missions and react to events. Your character steadily goes from the new guy with a knife to world saving hero who looks at the living incarnation of pure elemental power and tells his friends to leave because he got this. The story does a good job of switching the pace up to keep you interested and throws a few curveballs at you. Just when you think you're almost done the game just starts to take off.

World/Level design: 10/10
     The game's environments are absolutely beautiful and incredibly complex. The forest clearing you start in is actually far bigger than you initially realize as later missions will bring you back here to explore more of it. You will probably believe that is is around a 3rd of the size it actually is at first ranging from ground level beaches and woods to exploring the tallest treetops. Other zones are equally impressive. Unless you intentionally go back and start exploring everything the level design seems to do a good job at keeping you from accidentally wandering into places you aren't ready for but they are completely accessible from the start so good luck if you want to slay a rathian with your starter weapon and leather armor (at least it has fire resistance?). Other areas include a mountain top filled with coral that resembles a seafloor, a death and disease ridden cavern, so on. Each is worth taking the time to explore not only for the aesthetic but also for the various resources the you can find. A new addition to the MH series in this one is expeditions which essentially allow you to wander around any of the areas without any restrictions on time or KOs. This allows you to ""safely"" explore the areas and fight anything that spawns there. Gathering resources or practicing boss mechanics. I was thoroughly impressed by the size and detail given to the various areas.

Content/gameplay hours: 10/10
     People have thousands of hours in this game for good reason. The main story will take you anywhere from 35-60 hours depending on how much grinding and side quests you do. The end game super bosses are numerous and fun granting endless potential. The community is still very active so finding people online for the hunts (this is the part where soloing starts to become very difficult) is pretty quick. Due how different the play styles for each weapon is you can start a new save file and play again with a completely different control scheme.

- Get the mod that allows for skippable cutscenes. It saves a ton of time if you've already seen them on a previous playthrough. Same goes for decos if you don't want to spend hours upon hours leaving your fate up to RNG for the decorations you need. 

- If you're playing with friends, you'll need to launch most of the story hunts solo to watch the cutscenes, back out and then join your friends. Which can be a minor annoyance but wasn't too bad with the above cutscene skip mod. 

- Some of the controls are really funky on M&K, for example sword and shield needs to hold C and then press E to use items without sheathing your weapon which is super easy on controller.

I'm more of a Tranquilize them person and feel really bad when I accidentally kill them (which is a reason I HATE fighting Elder Dragons). That said, since you can capture most monsters in this game I do appreciate that, and this game is definitely credited for bringing Monster Hunter to the mainstream. This game is really fun with complex weapon systems and hardcore gameplay, each fight with the monsters feeling like they could be Souls boss. I wasn't a big fan of Iceborne, to be honest, and never finished it on console, but the base game I always enjoyed. 
I'm personally getting too old to enjoy these games much anymore (I can't really handle the stress of hunting for 40 minutes only to lose, and I find difficult, punishing games to not really be that enjoyable much anymore) but I bought this on PC to experiment with mods and I have to say, there's some really fun ones! It almost feels like Skyrim in its modability, and I discovered some that actually allows me to enjoy my favorite part of this series - Walking around the beautiful environments and just watching and studying the monsters, no worrying about going out and fighting them. So for the 400+ hours I enjoyed of this on console, and for the modability of this version allowing me to play it in a pacifist sense, it definitely gets a positive from me.",True,1197,70,1723928427,1723928650,0,0

76561199542776685,172305712,"Monster Hunter World is a strong contender for my favourite game of all time. Stunning graphics (although perhaps not quite ""AAA standard""), exciting gameplay with incredible depth, and essentially infinite replayability all work hand in hand for this game to claim that honour. 

Admittedly, the game is also one of the hardest games to get into that I've ever played. The first dozen (or couple dozen, depending on how much you take your time) hours span the worst ""tutorial"" that I've ever seen in a game - starting missions that are a diabolical juxtaposition of too handholdy (extensive tooltips and introductions) while not necessarily telling you everything you want to know. All that to say - this game essentially tells you that you have a skill issue and that you need to suck it up and learn the weapon you're using, learn the monster you're fighting, and figure out the item hotbar that at first seems like a curse from the devs but actually ends up being quite intuitive once you figure the damn thing out. And of course, the game is intentionally grindy - it's the gameplay loop, so if you aren't ready for that, it might not be for you. However, the grind is generally good fun. 

Along with that, the story is mediocre at best (although who cares that much, we're here to fight monsters) and the dialogue is painful, with a certain EVER PRESENT character as a glaring example of this. The unskippable cutscenes are annoying at best and agonizing at worst, especially when you've played through the game several times. And the way the multiplayer is handled needs a serious overhaul, as being unable to play through story missions with friends that you or they haven't completed yet makes it a pain to coordinate and ruins the potential to experience monsters for the first time with another newbie friend. 

All of those may sound like glaring flaws, but there is a silver lining, and boy oh boy is it a rich vein of silver. The combat is fluid and diverse, each weapon offering a unique playstyle and ensuring that there is almost certainly something for everyone. Want to take down a fire breathing T-Rex with a hammer to the skull? Bonk away, brother! Vanquish an ice wyvern with the over-the-top combination of sword, shield, and axe that is the Charge Blade? Charge those phials and take it down! Literally slay the god of all dragons with MHW's take on a minigun? This game has you covered. There are many, many monsters to take on, and the content is almost doubled (and far improved, in most cases) with the Iceborne DLC, which I recommend getting in a bundle with the base game. 

The ecosystems feel almost alive, and although certain maps may make you feel lost, the level of immersion that this game achieves with the living world Capcom created is incredible (and the FOOD LOOKS SCRUMPTIOUS). The fights are action packed and adrenaline inducing. There is no better feeling that I have found in a video game to date than finally mastering the tough fight that you spent so long getting kicked to the curb in. Maybe you land the KO combo you've been practicing, maybe you perfect parry the monster's signature move, and maybe you just tank the dang thing and laugh in its panting face while you heft your greatsword for the killing blow, one thing is certain: nothing can stop you now.

This game is easily worth full price, despite being years old at this point, but you can grab it on heavy discount quite a lot of the time. If you are to grab the bundle on sale, Iceborne is one of the best DLCs I have experienced, despite some flaws. I have simply sat down in the Seliana Gathering Hub hot spring and stared out at the gleaming sea for hours. No other game has managed to have quite the same effect. Give the game a shot, if you are willing to put in the time for the grind ahead. Buy it on sale, if you aren't sure - it is at least worth a try. Go through at least until beating Anjanath, at that point, the tutorial is more or less over and the hunts start to pick up the pace. And please, don't use the Guardian armor/weapons, as they will seriously ruin the fun of the game. You are supposed to lose, supposed to learn and grind to improve. Not use heavily boosted gear meant to speed experienced players through to the DLC. Unless a boring base game is your goal, avoid Guardian gear like the plague. 

If you made it all the way through my TED Talk, thanks for taking the time to read it. I don't write reviews on games and generally don't spend as much time gaming as I used to. However, Monster Hunter is one game that has stuck with me, and I can't wait to see what the future has in store with Wilds. Alright, having said all that, I'm heading back to the New World. Someone has been stealing my collection of Teostra foreskins that I hang on my mantelpiece as trophies and I intend to replenish my stock posthaste.

Flash forward 4, almost 5 years later and I get a new gaming laptop and realize oh hey, I should try monster hunter out again. Bought the DLC recently and my god I cannot believe I've been without this game for years. It took me quite a while both then and this time around to have the combat ""click"", as the weapons and combat function a bit differently than my brain is used to in other ARPG's. Recently I got heavily into Elden Ring + Dark souls and I feel this helped me quite a bit to understand how the combat in MHW works. Its slow, methodical, and you need to know what you want to do. Years ago I tried the greatsword and now again did, back then fell onto the dual blades. This time around I played the entire game with the switch axe and so so loved it. I'm now trying out the bow and its really good. Soon enough gonna get into Iceborne, tried the very very first DLC mission and got my ass handed to me in the defender set so I gotta do some farming.

76561199162403133,172287489,"Compared to its previous titles, Worlds is fairly adapted to a wider audience. I have been playing these games since I was 10, but I hold no bias. DRM bothers me because it affects my system performance, very drastically. 

The game is a grind, and requires a depth of understanding of skills, decorations, monsters, and everything else that is flung to you overtime. Obviously, you do not have to play this way, but there is a major difference in positive and negative opinion when you have all the correct gear, know what you are doing, and are having fun. This is quite possibly what turns most people away, and I have heard a faint amount of people regard the gameplay as ""soulslike"". Preparation is key, and I denounce the term ""get gud"" because this game requires more than basic skill. Weapon choice doesn't matter to those around you, just find what flows with you best and practice. 

The menu layouts and UI for Worlds have always been a small nuisance to me. I prefer the layout and general navigation of menus in Rise, and I also receive a variety of connection issues across all platforms (yes, I own the game on 3 platforms). There is a debate among tenderizing, and unfortunately, a lack of understanding about this one mechanic out of a plethora can lead to harder, longer hunts. 

Regardless, the game is fun, and good with friends. I haven't met any toxic hunters, either. If you can overcome the overwhelming flow of mechanics and gameplay options, I believe you will enjoy this game.

76561198079386093,172278256,"The good:

- Really immersive and in depth. You gotta prepare, craft, gear up, make builds, master your weapon(s) of choice and play on the monster's weaknesses using anything you can.
- Satisfying meaty combat, it may feel clunky in the start but once you get used to a weapon you like it feels good.
- Gorgeous world, visuals and graphics. MH World is the best Monster Hunter has ever looked.
- Easy to get into, hard to master.
- Lots of content!

The bad and annoying:

- Main story and story fights are mediocre and most of the characters are annoying and or useless.
- Game does NOT respect your time! It's very grindy, there's WAY too much RNG and it's VERY unkind.
- SO. MANY. TIME. WASTERS. Repeated small talk with NPC'S. Laggy/Delayed menus, repeated mini cutscenes for so many things. Unskippable cutscenes and even credits lol, and MANY more small annoying time wasters.
- Ambiguous stats, descriptions, skills and other things. e.g Bonuses when certain conditions are met (OK TELL ME WHICH CONDITIONS THEN?!), Stats boost (S) (M) (L) I WANNA SEE NUMBERS!, Weapon damage is 400, but it's actually 40, Elemental damage is 270 but it's actually 27 so now that's a combined 67, BUT NOW YOU GOT MOTION VALUES, PART MULTIPLIERS, TENDERIZING AND MANY OTHER CONDITIONALS AND I JUST AFDSAGRDFASHGA? (WHY CONFUSE ME AND MAKE ME DO UNNECESSARY MATH?)
- Some monsters are seriously annoying and a PITA. Kushala, Monkey, Behemoth, Black diablos, and any flying monsters with 90% fly time.
- Why does arena not have scaling for solo?
- Tedious multiplayer/co-op, Having to watch a cutscene separately, return from quest then join your friend or fire an SOS for every story quest is tedious and horribly implemented.

QOL wishlist is so long that if i would put them all here this review would run out of space but here are some:

- Skip repeated dialogue, please. Or why not separate functionality. Talk & Shop for example?
- Ability to turn off all and any notifications.
- Skip option for the countdown at the end of the missions. For multiplayer it could be a vote option.
- Can't see materials needed for gear unless in upgrade menu, why?
- Option to FULLY SKIP and DISABLE all mini cutscenes, i don't need to see and skip the chef cook food for the 1000th time or the smith make gear for the 100th time.
- Offline play option, i don't want to connect to servers every time i play solo.
- Be gone confirmation windows for everything.

I have lots of free time and I dont mind grinding in games, but this shit, I just can't.

*Rating: ★★★★★ (5/5)*

As a long-time fan of the Monster Hunter series, I had high expectations for *Iceborne*, and it absolutely exceeded them. Capcom has taken an already fantastic game and amplified everything with this expansion.

**Pros:**

1. **New Content Galore**: *Iceborne* introduces the Hoarfrost Reach, a massive and beautifully designed area filled with new monsters, biomes, and challenges. The new monsters are a mix of returning favorites and fresh designs, each with unique mechanics that keep hunts exciting.

2. **Master Rank**: The addition of Master Rank adds a whole new level of difficulty. Even the familiar monsters from the base game have been retooled to provide fresh challenges, making each hunt feel like a brand-new experience.

3. **Gameplay Enhancements**: The Clutch Claw is a game-changer, adding depth and strategy to the hunts. The new moves and combos for each weapon type make combat even more satisfying and dynamic.

4. **Endgame Content**: *Iceborne* doesn’t just stop after the story. The endgame content is rich, with the Guiding Lands offering a unique and customizable hunting experience that keeps you coming back for more.

5. **Visuals and Soundtrack**: The expansion is a visual feast, with detailed environments and stunning monster designs. The soundtrack complements the epic hunts perfectly, enhancing the overall immersion.

**Cons:**

1. **Learning Curve**: For newcomers, the increased difficulty and complexity of *Iceborne* might feel overwhelming. However, for those who stick with it, the payoff is immense.

2. **PC Performance**: While most of my experience was smooth, there were occasional frame drops during some of the more intense battles. This is something that might be worth optimizing.

**Final Thoughts:**

*Monster Hunter World: Iceborne* is a must-have for any fan of the series and an excellent expansion that adds hundreds of hours of content. Whether you’re a seasoned hunter or new to the franchise, *Iceborne* offers an exhilarating and rewarding experience. This is Monster Hunter at its best.

This is the first Monster Hunter I've played so I don't have any experience with previous titles, but I also had not many expectations. I understand the appeal of this game, I really do. But it's really not a game for me. When a game takes more than an hour to begin to be fun, I doubt it will ever happen.

Negative;

    [*]the pacing is soooo slow, everything takes forever
    [*]no gameplay flow, you get interrupted all the time, quest design doesn't help either

Some monsters and areas look cool. And learning each of their mechanics by dying over and over elden ring style to finally get the rush of killing them may be fun to some, but the lack of any coherent (or interesting) narrative, every system being ridiculously obscure without an experienced player to explain them to you and the recycling of each monster throughout the whole game makes it quite a boring slog to others.

76561198077111729,172185773,"I really want to give this game a thumbs up. I've sadly been spoiled with previous generation monster hunter games and this one is just.. not it. 

The difficulty is too easy for me. It took 20 hours to cart the first time, due to my controller dying. I actually never carted once in the base game. It wasn't until Iceborne launched that I actually started to cart frequently on hunts. High Rank armor being insufficient in Master Rank quests is indeed true for World. Even the most basic of MR sets can satisfy your defenses until elder dragons show up. 

World itself is an introduction to the West. Prior games required you to set up a Japanese account on the nintendo shop and either use your phone's translate option, or through developing muscle memory to navigate the menus. I've got about 2500 hours in MHXX, fortunately that game did come to the West as MHGU. Man oh man, it is MHGU's fault that my experience with World was so lack luster. 

You may look at my 100+ hours and say, well, that's quite a lot of time for the investment of money. While this may be true, there is a 15 dollar game on the nintendo E shop that will give you 2000+ hours of playtime, and that won't unlock everything or even half of everything. World's content was complete in about 30 hours. Iceborne added about 50 hours to that. End game grinding is just not fun when the only real challenge is hoping you get good RNG for that deco you want. 

I think World undersold what Monster Hunter is. The QoL changes may be welcome now, but in the future when they become common place and the community still cries; ""It's too hard"". It will only continue to be made easier and easier.

Monster Hunter's core gameplay loop is what is so much fun. Start with basic gear, kill a monster, use it's drops to build better gear, kill a stronger monster, etc. It's fun having to master a monster to learn what movers can it do, at what distance, and what you can do to play around those timings. When the monster is so easy that you don't need to learn these timings, the fun goes out the window. Hitting something, brainlessly with no real strategy or reason, is boring. 

I wish there was a middle road for a review score. The game looks great, runs great, has cool armors and weapons, and the monsters interact with each other and the environment. The difficulty is just not there for me, and I fear it will only get easier as time goes on. They are already showing off gameplay of the new MH: Wilds. You can turn your character to aim your weapon, like a great sword. This makes using Great Sword much easier, and in turn, lowers the skill cap immensely. It's taking a lot of the fun of mastering a weapon and more importantly, as previously stated, mastering the monster you're hunting. 

I can't think of a single monster I mastered in World. It was simply 10-15 minute fights all the way up to Safi Jiva and the end game Edlers. 

Looking back in MHXX/MHGU, which I haven't played since 2019, I can still remember mastering Dreadqueen  and Dreadking Rath. Formulating your set and load out actually mattered and a single mistake proved fatal on the higher tiers of quests. You had to know the mechanics, timings, and the ins and outs of your weapons and arts if you were to stand a chance against these end game monsters.

76561198053298401,172135538,"I was very much hard on this game at release, frankly its better than I had given it credit but it is still one of my least favorite MH titles. 
The biggest complaints I have are

1)  How terribly cluttered every single zone is with foliage (Camera is frequently covered and makes getting blindsided by attacks a frequent occurrence especially in the Ancient Forest). This also ties into how obscured hidden passages are because of lack of distinction from regular background details. 

2) How many ""special animations"" there are in this game. You're frequently teetering around like a toddler because the ground is too sloped, stumbling up ledges where you can't dodge, slowly recovering from attacks, jumping off ledges, and slowly climbing massive walls of vines. This worked in 4 Ultimate or Generations/Ultimate where this was used much more sparsely but it struggles to keep up with the sheer amount of interactions in World's environment brings
 
3) Dazed status is a nightmare in this game. In past titles the status was quickly taken care of by jiggling the thumbstick to shake it off, but because of the ""cheek slap"" animation, you're spending almost double time just getting back to control your character. I get the idea of making use of Decos to nullify this effect but this is massive overkill. 

4) There's so many cutscenes where you're forced to slowly walk from area to area, I could not imagine playing this a second time with how badly the game demands you pay attention to what it wants to show you. Not only that but it takes so much time to get from Point A to Point B where you're just forced to ""hold forward and listen"". Its very much a modern day angle for game making that Capcom is shifting toward in the most painful of ways. 

All in all, this game has grown on me. I still feel like the new monster designs are weak and lacking when sized up next to the originals, and the naming conventions they went with are just poor in a way that almost doesnt feel like Mionster Hunter names. 

I would give this game a 5/10, but in terms of a thumbs up or down system I could only do a down. 

If you're looking for a better offering, the base game of Monster Hunter Rise is vastly superior in all aspects, but the Sunbreak Expansion drags it down nearly to the level of World.

The games have always been great, but World is the first game to really try to step out of the game's largely handheld shoes and embrace more modern technologies. The controls aren't perfect, but the camera control is leagues better than in the past. Proper camera control makes easily makes this one of the top MH games in the series. Then there's the maps. Huge improvements were made here. In the past, MH maps have always been cool, but due to how a map was broken into zones  it felt less like a real world and more like a series of set pieces linked together. Now, we get a proper living, breathing world. Now monsters interact with the environment and each other. It makes hunts FEEL like a hunt. Its fantastic. And while certain zones are definitely more visually interesting than others, they are all really well realised. The weapons are still great, and have been made better by the addition of new mechanics for each of them. Some got more impactful overhauls than others (the greatsword didn't change much, the bowguns and bows feel much better), but they all feel great. I'd be shocked if you couldn't find a weapon to fit your playstyle.

it's an fun and addicting game. 

I find that every player you stumble upon online are super helpful and 
they show you various cool things you might want to try out. 

Admittedly, I found the game a bit overwhelming with all the items and possibilities unlocked right from the start. I felt that I didn't get a good introduction to many of the game's core features. For example, I can't remember that the game showed various stuff as that you can take shortcuts with grapple hook bugs, and that you actually can craft tools yourself too (to obtain the tools for capturing monsters etc.) 

I personally didn't enjoy that there was an crazy amount of items available right from the start. I found my inventory full of various mushrooms, insects, flowers, ammo types etc, that I had no idea about. I found by experiience, that I could easily ignore 90% of the items and features until many hours in to the game. I think I survived with just the Health potion and my Whetstone the first 20-30 hours or so. Gradually, I learned that there aren't THAT many items, maybe 20-30 common ingredients and then 30 types of ammo (you can completely ignore ammo unless you use a ranged weapon). It's just felt overwhelming that every ingredient is available right from the start. If you are a new player, and happen to feel the same about the inventory, just be sure to pickup ""herb"" and ""honey"", so that you can craft more health potions. 

That said, I highly recommend picking up this game!",True,31768,6509,1723520922,1723615803,20,0

76561198842799443,172016080,"Monster Hunter Rise[a] is a 2021 action role-playing game developed and published by Capcom for the Nintendo Switch. It was released worldwide in March 2021, with a Windows port released in January 2022 and ports for PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X/S were released in January 2023. An expansion pack, Sunbreak, was released in June 2022.

Rise follows many of the new conventions established in Monster Hunter: World while also introducing new features and mechanics, including a new animal companion called a Palamute that can be used to ride across the map or into battle, and the use of Wirebugs to traverse the world and mount and ride certain monsters. The game received generally positive reviews upon release with critics praising the gameplay and its expansion of the mechanics introduced in World. It has sold more than 15 million copies worldwide since launch, making it the second best-selling game in the series.

Worldborne is not the best Monster Hunter, nor it is the worst, as if there even is a bad Monster Hunter title. They’re all great and loveable in their own ways.

Monster Hunter is not a game for everyone; it won’t click immediately, and the combat can feel like a chore at times if you don’t fully understand the concept of openings and planning out attacks, but when it clicks, you’d understand why people have sunk thousands of hours into this franchise, and thankfully I’m glad to be a 3rd gen hunter.

1. if you planning to actually dive deep and enjoy this game to its finest, Do not use the Defender Gears and weapons, use the actual monsters armors and weapons since that is prty much the true big part of the game, Making powerful gears and managing the skills to hunt stronger monsters.

if u just wanna go fast straight to DLC tho? well i guess just use the Defender Gears (FYI: Defender Gears gave u the high stats and dmg that prty much scales up way too far for the base game, so yea ur prty much accelerating the base game story progress way to quick if u use this equipment, bcz of how strong it is which is reasonable for reaching Iceborne quicker).

2. try to enjoy the game first. i know the fainting and grinding for gears can be prty tiring but trust me its very rewarding and the constant hunting and re hunting the same monsters is indeed the fun part of the game (i remember back in base game i kill 20 Black Diablos in a day with charge blade just for its rare twisted Horn drop and only got like 4 lmao)

there are 14 weapon types in mhw all with different playstyle and moves from Melee to Ranged. so pick a weapon, try it on the training ground and see which one do u like more that fit ur style and gameplay!

3. BUY the Iceborne DLC. since 50% of the full content of the game is locked in there (i know 2x, such a boomer right but the same goes to MH RISE too and MH have always been like this with Extra Content). but i assure you its VERY worth it to get the DLC. more monsters, new stronger weapons and gears, more equipments, more weapon moveset and skills and finally ofcourse the Endgame Content
(i especially really recommend to get this on Discount).

4. if u wanna play good and actually learn the game, DO NOT SOS until you hit a wall on the monsters hunt and it became frustrating to you. back in base game i don't even know online session existed lol, but yea i used to count atleast 10x failed hunt 1st until i finally decide to SoS. so try to the learn the mechanic, the weapons, the monsters move, and all the aspect of the game.

This is proly my biggest advice for you, LEARN TO HUNT/FIGHT cuz if u keep SOS ing ur way to iceborne and to endgame, ur prty much going to struggle bcz ur lackness of ability to survive a hunt and fighting, and most importantly you will likely immediately dropping the game bcz u don't get the true experience of hunting in Monster Hunter cuz people keep doing it for you. especially if YOU are the type of person who easily get bored and drop games quickly.

5. DON'T BE AFRAID TO JOIN AN ONLINE SESSION. you can ask for advice and help to the people there on online sessions! no worry MHW Community is very friendly and most of the time we always help each other, neither its learning a weapon, skills, hunting or even progressing ur Quest. also don't be afraid to die/faint on a hunt bcz most 999 like me or even any veteran hunters will understand and won't be mad and scold you :D

if u wanna try to enjoy the game and actually learn i can also help you to tell the way :) hit me up if u wanna hunt together!

6. this is for items management, GRAB ANY MATERIALS YOU SEE IN THE MAP. this is very important for starters, because you gonna need a lot of stuff if u wanna make some useful items like healing, Buff potion, traps, flash pod, and even for some Armors and Weapons. so pay attention to the materials and see what u need for crafting cuz lots of it will still be useful till Endgame!

oh yea, also try to understand what items do to you, cuz some of it will highly beneficial to you and the weapon ur using, like dash juice is very good for Stamina related weapons for example.

7. lastly, Just enjoy the flow of the game. no need to hasten everything, MHW progression is supposed to be slow so its fine to take some times hunting lots of monsters, understanding the game and strengthening your Gears. so just do ur hunt, learn the weapons, understand the mechanic, and continue the Story :)

there's more that i can say for new players tbh but i think this 7 point is probably some of the important stuff that i can say to you, so yeah see you in hunt Hunters!",True,232701,206279,1723433246,1723433246,1,0

76561199100491507,171936001,"I originally got World for the Xbox One for my birthday years ago, but a friend was kind enough to buy me a key for the Steam version recently, and I say without a shadow of a doubt that MHW is one of, if not the best games I've ever played. Technically my first Monster Hunter game right next to Generations Ultimate, World holds a very special place in my heart, and it helped get me into the franchise. I'd hugely recommend this to Monster Hunter fans or those who like action games/RPGs in general, though there are a few pros and cons to consider should you decide to try it:

Pros
- Vast and immersive environments
- Gameplay and UI is really well done
- Tons of weapons and armor to craft and choose from
- Online co-op (can be helpful for people who are having a hard time doing certain quests solo)
- Player, Palico and room customization

Cons
- Steep learning curve
- Steep rise in difficulty during late game which can be overwhelming for new players and those unprepared
- Some menus are a bit clunky and could have been designed better
- Farming for rarer parts can get repetitive
- Unable to have other players help you in quests without firing SOS Flares (tbf this was fixed in Rise)
- CPU-intensive, especially on weaker devices

While the cons can make the game a bit frustrating, they're balanced out by the pros which makes it enjoyable. And with Wilds coming out next year, here's hoping it'll be just as good, if not better than World.",True,7862,3247,1723427457,1723497193,0,0

I have played hundreds of hours on the xbox but due to being hyped about Wilds coming out and finally getting a PC, I've restarted from the beginning. I love nearly every minute of the game, its challenging and rewarding, also painfully frustrating at times but the most fun I have had in any game.

IF YOU ARE NEW to the franchise, there will be a learning curve. You will die.. Alot. But do not be disheartened my fellow hunter, find a weapon that suits the way you play and master it (check out Arekkz gaming on youtube). There are some epic hunts awaiting you if you can get past some of the walls in the game. Biggest tip I can give is don't get greedy and watch the monster, it will tell you all you need to know. A cart is just another lesson learned.

There is more I would love to say but this will get too long. If any new hunters to be see this and need some help I'm more than happy to assist.",True,7002,5868,1723418325,1723418386,0,0

76561198077177864,171920176,"Listen here, lad. Ain't nothing better than the Switchiest of Axes, and 'ere's why.

You have an Axe that transforms into a goddamn sword. What's that? Charge Blade does the same thing? You don't need that pussy ass shield. With the Switchiest of Axes, you don't need a shield, because it's all about that MANLY DEE-PEE-ASS, baby. You got hops. You got rolls. If you get hit, take it like a MAN. I don't care if you're male, female or Gigginox. Hack-and-slash? You're damn right. They don't call this fancy dildo the Slash Axe back in Japan for nothin', son.

Having trouble keeping up with that Great Jaggi because you have to sheathe every five seconds? YOU PIECE OF DUNG. you ever seen a Greatsword user slowly plod across the map with his gigantic peni- I mean, sword in hand? Your Sword mode is just as big, so you have to sheathe it, right? WRONG, SUCKER. Roll after that Beastie. Evade Extender will give you the boost your puny chicken legs need to keep up with the monster. Ever wanted to be a Konchu? Well, now you'll be rolling all over the damn place for that sweet, sweet manly DEE-PEE-ASS. And when the monster falls down, what do you do?

You blow your fuckin' load all across their face, that's what. X+A in sword mode for that delicious explosive burst that will take a chunk out of your bar and sharpness, but will also obliterate a pretty part of the monster's body. If you're a bit of a pussy and need to pull out (heh), pull the circle pad back and you'll do a premature e... explosion that doesn't take nearly as long. Nothing is manlier than EXPLOSIONS, except maybe Evade Extender. (GET IT. YOU PUSSY)
But it's called the Switch Axe, not the Switch Blade. (Wazzat? Charge Blade? Giggit out of here) That means the Axe is equally as capable as the Sword. You ever used the Axe of the Charge Blade? That thing is slower than a drowsy Basarios. Not this Axe. This Axe is a hurricane, a storm of manly steel, and it has stupidly huge range. Ever wished your little toothpick SnS and Dual Blades could reach that Gravios tail that dangles oh-so-close but just out of reach? AXE MODE, KELBITCH. That motherfucker is the Deviljho dick in a land of Jaggis. Every tail in the game is yours, every one of them (except maybe Fatalis, he's a bastard). And what happens when you upswing a teammate? COME ON AND SLAM, AND WELCOME TO JAPAN

And did you know which weapon has the manliest DEE-PEE-ASS when a monster has fallen? SWITCH AXE, APTOFUCKA. Upswing into rapid chops will turn any monster into choice cuts for sale at the hunter's market later. Do this on the tail a few times and soon you'll hear the tasty sound of it falling off. Get used to this sound, because soon you'll be chopping off tails everywhere and drown in Mantles and Palliums. The Manly Chops of Doom ain't nuttin to mess around with.
You know that huge diddlydong you're slapping against that monster's thighs? No, I don't mean that, I mean your Switch Axe, which I'm sure you've picked up by now because it's the MANLIEST. Turns out that not only is it a diddlydong, it's a transforming diddlydong. Tilting the Circle Pad forward and pressing X in Axe mode makes you do a short forward stab, then hit R and X after then to MANLY SHIFT into Sword mode with a slash. OR, you can do the MANLY CHOPS OF DOOM, then finish it off with a tap of R to do this magnificent Reverse Roundhouse Slash. After the RRS, hit that R one more time to MANLY SHIFT into Sword Mode. In Sword Mode, whenever your sword sweeps horizontally, R+X shifts you back into Axe form to EXPAND DONG. (seriously, the Axe is so fucking long.)

Switch Axe is versatile, too. You want extra MANLINESS? Get a power phial. Want to see that monster pant for breath as you turn it into the next main course? Exhaust Phials. You can even KO the monster if you're manly enough. Want to support your significantly less manly teammates? Para Phial, Poison Phial, blah blah, they're all yours. Or is the monster weak to element? Get that element phial, or use the Dragon phial (because we all know Dragon is the manliest element). The possibilities are endless, just like the apparent reach of your Axe.

The cycle of -> gathering -> hunting -> crafting is super satisfying, and seeing yourself progress to larger and more difficult monsters gives a sense of accomplishment on the same scale as a game like dark souls. With there being no XP or Skill trees, you know for sure that when you take down a monster its down to the choices you made on what items, armor, food, and weapon to use, as well as your own skills.

You have hours of fun stuff to do and many hours you can spend with your friends and show them how to hunt them monsters. My only one gripe is the sheer amount of new people who play this game using the Defender gear. It is given to you, but I encourage new players to not even look at it, as it makes the start of the game, where you're supposed to be learning the games mechanics and how to read and counter monsters, that much more challenging later on when they reach High and Master Rank.

76561198078746306,171813521,"I feel like this one of the only RPGs I enjoy. No leveling stats to worry about screwing up, only gear materials. Combat feels somewhat like Dark Souls in that getting hit tends to hurt a lot, attacking at the wrong time gets you hit, and memorizing when and how to dodge are how you stay alive. Also atrocious hitboxes all around. That's pretty much where the similarities end. Every weapon plays drastically differently, so give them all a chance to see what clicks with you. This game feels like it was designed around co-op. Usually, you'll want 4 players including yourself. There are still some active lobbies at the time of writing, but I still recommend bringing your own friends if possible. Higher level gear can annihilate low rank mobs at lightning fast speeds, and many players have had the time to get past the entirety of Master Rank and the special bosses added after. This has also given rise to one of my favorite pastimes, which is seeing how quickly my friends and I can delete the Great Jagras at the beginning of the game. You likely won't need to pay attention to much beyond the armor level of your gear in low rank hunts, but later on you'll need to set up a proper build to maximize your damage and your life. You'll likely be swapping armor somewhat often as you progress through the game, and less so when you hit the end of high rank, then repeating the process again through master rank. I don't really play Souls games, so this is one of the harder games I like playing. Some of it will feel unfair. Sometimes you'll get stunned, or oneshot, or hit by something that should have missed by a mile. But it's doable, and not just by Souls junkies. Take a break, bring a friend, and run it again. Unlike Souls games, you've got nothing to lose except the time you spent hunting that specific monster. You're not punished for taking the time to learn here. You don't need to retrace your steps for half an hour or worry about losing any money. Also you can get layered armor to run separate gear for cosmetics and stats if you wanna play Fashion Hunter, but that's endgame stuff. Happy hunting.",True,17769,17583,1723280933,1723280933,2,0
76561198019966189,171810247,"Not for me. That's my final verdict. For a game title to have the word ""World"" in it I thought I was going to be dropped into an open world environment, where I can free roam and explore and kill monsters. Nope. This anime game is just a linear pipe run where you go from quest to quest (quest = hunt or capture monster, or gather items), you're dropped in a very limited environment each time, to hunt one monster that you run into easily within one minute as it's footprints are right outside your base. Then you spend the next 10 just chipping away it's health that's not even visible. 

Everyone claims it's ""the hunt"" and ""preparation"" that's the goal of the game, but that's just lazy. This game is dull. It's incredibly repetitive. It has a poor UI, the graphics are a bit blurry, the combat is clunky, you have way too many tutorials with walls of text because the game developers didn't bother to create a story that introduces you to the mechanics of the game. I just can't get into this. 

Some will say how brilliant Japanese people are at creating these types of games, but I just say it's lazy. The environment is so boring that I can't enjoy it.

I will recommend this game simply because it works well. There are no bugs, the mechanisms (even though clunky) work well, but if you've played and enjoyed free roam games like Witcher 3, Skyrim, Elden Ring, Fallout, Grand Theft Auto etc. you will not enjoy this game.",True,982,768,1723276389,1723284434,0,0

So that is my one big criticism, that there were so many stylish weapons and armour pieces available, and yet I beat the final boss with such boring crap as the Bone Armour Set and a Kulu-Ya-Ku Hammer because they were actually perfectly good gear even compared to what I would have crafted from killing Elder Dragons for 10 hours straight.

Still, loved the game, loved hitting the monsters and how they would react to your attacks, get caught in traps, have turf wars, etc. It's like no other action game for sure and definitely worth playing, even the base game, even if you only play the story.",True,2412,2412,1723171634,1723171634,0,0

76561197977241317,171569855,"I uh, I played a while (10 hours). then I got frustrated and left it alone for a while. but you know how skill based games work, you eventually come back with a new mindset. before my break, I had stubbornly stuck to great sword, one of the FOURTEEN playstyle options for weapons. because I never really tried using anything else, I kept seeing my methods not work over and over. I had hit a major wall in both progression and enthusiasm.
then I realized my mistake, I hadn't even touched any of the other 13 options. so I came back with the idea of just trying out the other options. After going through most of the melee options, I landed on charge blade. it was mobile, had both fast & weak and slow & strong attack options, could block, and was just complex enough to make every fight interesting. before I knew it, I sank another 60 hours in and had beaten the base game solo with charge blade

before we go further, I want to say that all the weapons are fun and none are necessarily better than others. I certainly have my preferences, but that's not to say I dislike the other options. I believe that every hunter should spend at least 15 minutes messing around with each weapon to try them all out, even multiple times throughout progression because attitudes can change.

the iceborne expansion is a must. not for the clutch claw that everyone seems to have mixed feelings about. it's the changes to weapon movesets that makes mid-combo transitions flawless. it's for the new monsters and difficulty that weren't there in base game. it's for the completely customizable room that you can get PTSD'd from because you can set the ambience music to the theme of your most painful monster fight. it's for the grammeowster chef, who makes the best food ever to be found in a video game. it's for the new armor and weapon designs that look either truly ridiculous or insanely awesome. 
I beat the entire expansion twice, putting in 300 hours grinding gear and powering through tough fights. when I beat the expansion the first time, I went into the post game content by myself and spent another 400 hours getting the high level gear and learning movesets.
screw metas, have fun with your journey. I grinded the same fight for 30 hours after learning how it worked just to flex on the AI monster. I did that for all the endgame fights. the amount of time you can put into the game with one weapon and then realize you know nothing about the other options is insane.

the entire game is a learning experience. learn the basic mechanics first, then learn the weapons, then pick one and master it, then learn the monsters. the learning curve is steep at first, I won't deny that. the moment of realization where you learn how everything clicks together in a fight, that's what you play for.
this game is an investment of time, sure. but that's how all games work. you put in time, you get enjoyment out of it. it's your choice what you invest in. I've chosen to invest in this one because I like it :)

TL;DR
slow start, but with time it turns into really fun challenges. do recommend expansion, but try base game first (start of high rank is what I would call a good time to pick to get it)

76561199304818486,171519829,"It's a masterpiece that still holds up after six years. If you want a game that teaches you its mechanics in a way that feels fulfilling and has minimal BS, I highly recommend this game. The same goes for the DLC! If you love the base game, Iceborne is that but cranked up to 11.

However, this is a challenging game. You WILL see a difficulty bump once you get to Iceborne, and like most Monster Hunter games, it expects you to have been playing in the moment. What I mean by that is that MHW is known for its title updates. A few monsters and events would be dropped then, culminating in the end-game updates. You would have been playing on and off at that time. HOWEVER, nearly everything, including the end-game fights, is unlocked immediately after you beat Shara. That includes 4 of the most brutal fights in the game—raging, Furious, Alatreon, and Fatalis. The game expects you to have been playing for a while before even dropping into those fights and playing a certain...grinding. 

Here comes the main problem with Iceborne!!! THE GUIDING LANDS. (Oh my god, he said the thing.) The Grinding Lands is a boring, tedious, repetitive way to make you extremely powerful. It was so powerful that to make those fights not look like a joke, Capcom made them some of the hardest fights in the series. It's not the game. THE SERIES. However, those fights are extremely satisfying once you get to the level where you won't lose 72% of your health on a single hit. It just shows that Capcom didn't think about balancing the endgame well 

Fatalis was an excellent and challenging final boss, but he was a great send-off to the game.

Patreon needs a rework. NOT WITH THE FIGHT. But instead about the inner workings. It sucks that if you are a CB user, your main damage-dealing attack. Your literal BREAD AND BUTTER does nothing. The game doesn't show which weapons work best, and the fight was good; the foundation it was built around was terrible for those who aren't in the know. The elemental building in this game is HORRIBLE. A lot of slots are needed for very little return. That's why you should use the Defender set or ANY blast weapon. You will be carried until you fight Patreon. I cannot blame the player base. Because we still need to get a say in making Blast Meta. It just turned out that way. However, capcom's remedy for this is making some fights completely easy if you have a particular element.  That is a fun fact if you usually play. You CAN only beat alatreon with a fire, ice or dragon element weapon. That is what rubs me the wrong way. Alatreon is, to most people, the 2nd most brutal fight in the game, and he limits what Monster Hunter is all about, which is build crafting. The next step after him is the final boss of the game. I get what Capcom was trying to do, and honestly, i LOVE the idea of suppressing eschaton judgment. GOD SUCH A GOOD MECHANIC. I wish that other elements did something or, better yet, worked the different aspects into the fight. Have thunder and water stagger alatreon more and not PREVENT ESCHATON but instead extend the time till. That would make it a modern-day behemoth and maybe a start to introducing more raid mechanics into MH. Fire and Ice prevent it from killing you, the dragon can break the horns to prevent it from changing elements, and water and thunder stagger and extend your invisible timer. It was a good fight, but the end game ultimately made the build-up to the battle unbearable.

TLDR: This game is worth its weight in gold, but the endgame kinda sours the experience. not too much to become unbearable. But just enough that it is noticeable. Thank god capcom fixed it in rise.

I prefer MHW so far. The world building is more dynamic and the combat, imo, is superior because it is slower. The lack of wirebug makes the fight a lot more methodical. In Rise, it feels like the only correct way to play the game is to counter everything.

I only MHW play single-player because I'm an adult woman who just wants to enjoy her me-time. 

Pros
+ The game loop is unique and satisfying. 
+ The amount of craft that goes into every detail of this game is impressive and enjoyable. I particularly love the attention to the sound design! Every monster has different roars and sounds and stuff. Rad! 
+ I also love the level design.
+ It might seem complicated, but actually it is not hard to learn it one little piece at a time while progressing at whatever pace is comfortable for you.
+ I named my Palico after my cat who later passed away, so having Shadow help me in every hunt is a joy.

Worldbuilding: Nice

The Bad:

Cutscenes: Unskippable

Loading screens: Long

Menu animations: Long

Drinking / getting up animations: Long

Input: Delayed

Auto-Sheathe and Dash on L3 are standard options that sheathed my weapon while wanting to shoot until I figured out how to disable that

Guiding Lands: You lose exp when you gain exp

Monsters: Randomly jumping through walls

Hitboxes: lol

Velkhana: Bright white arena with a bright white monster with bright white moves + ice + dust + fog that just kill your eyes

Clutch Claw: Will either miss literally at point blank range, or randomly jump to another body part. 

Also Clutch Claw: Range too short to hit a monster when literally standing in front of it, but you can somehow shoot at Wedge Beetles on the other side of the planet

Also Clutch Claw: Tenderizing is necessary to deal damage, but you will be getting knocked off unless the monster is already tired from you dealing damage

Community: The death of any series is complacency. If you love something, you want it to be the best it can be. 
This is not true for this ""fanbase"" however, because even hinting at not 100% loving every single feature of this will make this community treat you like you murdered their families. 

The most annoying part of this is all the content creators lying how ""amazing"" this is and jumping on the bandwagon. 

Also Community: They love bombarding you with half-idead ""advice"" and ""help"" they may or may not have read somewhere with semi-knowledge.

I now wish I'd gotten it sooner. It really does deliver a fully realized world with tons of life. And you go out to capture, harvest and slay it.
There is a ton of minutia, from crafting your armor, pendants and weapons to get certain bonuses to items for buffs or attacks, just like any Monster Hunter game. I just grab whatever looks cool and has a big number on it and do just fine.
A lot of what you pick up out in the field is auto crafted, such as healing potions. Pick up an herb and there's a potion in your bag. Grab some honey and now its a mega potion. 
I think Capcom was worried about players getting lost or not being able to find what you can pick up because there are fireflies that help show you where to go or fly to nearby bugs and things. I find it distracting and helpful at the same time.
I've now played about as much Monster Hunter Rise as World. I've seen strong opinions in favor of one or the other. I like them both. I think for multiplayer I'd choose Rise, for immersion I'd take World.",True,1948,1797,1722622033,1722622033,0,0

The weapon mechanics can get a bit complicated, depending on which one you use, but combat is overall very fun and satisfying. It isn't too hard and it isn't too easy, making each success feel very gratifying. 
Very fun with friends, too! Multiplayer seems optimized and I'd say encouraged, as well. Playing with others feels like the intended experience.
That being said, my only critique is that there are unskippable cutscenes, so if it's your second playthrough or you (like me) don't really care about the story, you're forced to mash through dialogue and sit through it.",True,7699,6330,1722613293,1722613293,0,0

Combat is not as polished and fluid as it could be leading to sometimes frustrating and slow hunts. Gathering crafting items and micromanaging different gameplay systems to maximize buffs and rewards is extremely tedious. The story is bland and not much to speak of. The real enjoyment in this game comes from executing well-planned hunts and learning to fight new monsters. Unfortunately, lack of variety causes the spark to be lost before the game really gets going.

76561198884262086,171072595,"[h3] TLDR; One of my favorite games of all time (for now), strongly recommend. [/h3]

Being my first proper introduction to Monster Hunter (played Freedom Unite in the PSP for like 5 minutes years ago), I recommend playing this game to whoever may read this.

Coming from games like Elden Ring/Dark Souls and then playing this, it's somewhat difficult to adjust in the beginning of the game with the lock-on system and its controls. As I further played the game, I preferred simply not locking on due to possible camera shenanigans. The game didn't fully hook me in initially as I feel somewhat overwhelmed with the amount of systems, tutorials, and mechanics that pop-ups from the game really didn't help me that much. However, playing the game naturally makes you familiar with this mechanics. Though I do admit that when I mained the longsword, I didn't really use the counter mechanics i.e. foresight slash and Iai Spirit slash, so I was basically using the longsword like it was pre 5th gen monster hunter until Rajang which I'm surprised I made it that far. What really hooked me in at first was defeating my first rathalos and diablos. Sturggling from them and defeating them, as those were the first monsters that really took some time for me to defeat made the game click for me. The Iceborne DLC is what really made me invested as Barioth was my first real wall in the game as I change my build and took me 2 attempts and more than 30 minutes to beat. However, my second wall was Rajang post-DLC story which really tested my skill and made me take a break in the game and reevaluate how I use the longsword in the first place. With this, I still remember my grueling yet satisying first hunt of Raging Brachydios and Furious Rajang which took me 40 mins in both of those hunts solo.

I enjoyed grinding and beating monsters, and really enjoyed joining SOS of people. It's what made me play the game more, even after defeating Fatalis and basically getting my perfect set for my longsword. With me joining SOS and my drive to play the game more, I tried and played all the weapons except for the gunlance in the time of writing. The mobility of the Insect Glaive, the spammy braindead big damage of ZSD of the switch axe, the absurd damage of spread (with special scope) HBG, and etc. Using different weapons makes the game fresh and makes me approach monsters in different ways so I highly recommend other people to try different weapons. The clutch claw mechanics I personally don't mind, however the reliance for this especially in wallbanging and agitator being meta makes it so that either the monster is down or enraged in basically all hunts once you are familiar and have mastered the clutch claw. Overall, I still like it and if it ever comes back, I hope it is implemented better.

I feel satisfaction in helping other people in high rank and master rank. People replying and commenting how they were stuck in this monster for some time and with my help and other people during that hunt made it possible to defeat that monster made me happy. I have helped multiple people from the start of their journey to the endgame (Fatalis) and played coop with them in grinding and progressing, and it makes me happy despite basically 'replaying' the game, as I find multiplayer hunts very fun.

For the cons of the game, the most apparent one is the lack of unique layered weapons especially in the base game, though Iceborne fixes that (mostly) with the DLC monsters having somewhat unique layered weapons though they still have those 'slap-on' weapons. The mandatory waiting for cutscenes before other players can join the quest is annoying, though MHRise have fixed that. Playing Rise after world, I wish that changing the color pigment of the layered armor has more customization. The filters and joining of lobbies for the sieges could also be better as I sometimes play with friends, when joining lobbies, and it shows that we can all join, one person usually cannot join as it is 'full' despite checking the playerlist that the lobby is 15/16. I am unsure how this happens.

Overall, I really like this game and made me a Monster Hunter fan and because of it, I decided to play the older generation games (in my own pace and when I have the time and motivation).",True,49040,37205,1722314216,1722314216,0,0

Monster Hunter World is a fantastic game, I don't really have words to describe it, it's its own experience.  

If you like tough as nails boss battles, you'll like MHW.
If you like build crafting and goal setting, you'll like MHW.
If you like casually walking and wandering around, you'll like MHW.

The game is deep but not overwhelming, both challenging and rewarding, you can find a plateau that's comfortable for you or keep working to climb the skill curve, it's a little bit of everything.  And on top of all that, Monster Hunter World is absolutely beautiful, sometimes I'll just stop and stare at how well crafted Monster Hunter World's WORLD is.

The best way I can say it is this: Monster Hunter World is a kind of dis/comfort food, it's got everything from chocolate chip cookies and habanero peppers depending on your mood.  One of my favorites, one of the great.

The mission picked cannot be set to online multiplayer before starting the mission, players needed to signal a SOS flare in the middle of the hunt, where you can also be hit by a monster during the process.
Penalties are a bit too severe imo, the maximum health and stamina will be reduced every time you fainted but you don't get a chance to eat a meal after fainting to increase the two bars (only if you spent long enough at the field and the system told you that you could take another bite). Sometimes the monster missed its move and stomped the area near the character, instead of standing up quickly, the character would then crawl on the ground  where it usually ends up being knocked out by the monster.

Played an additional 55hrs, still feel the same and even worse. The guiding lands is pure suffering, often disturbed by other monsters which ain't the targeted one. Thought that using the dung pod would be a great idea, NOPE, some of them choose to stay even after three shots in the face. Decorations are another ahithole worth to mention, just couldn't get the jewel I need for my build.

76561198318617582,170292498,"One of the most greatest games of all time. Capcom's best selling and for good reason. The base game is outstanding if you like the monster hunting genre and is only amplified by the ice-borne DLC which basically adds a second game on top of the first game I am over 400 hours in this game and I only just beaten the DLC. Surely you can sink 1000+ hours into this game. Play it on Weekends,Weekdays,Short breaks and long waits. You know why?  Because this game respects your time it allows you to go at your own pace. For that alone it deserves a consideration. Not to mention that this game can be played with friends and a pretty good community. The game even goes on sale constantly now.

The only Cons I can say about the game are the DLC cosmetic items(Hair and room pieces only). Even then the stuff you get in the base game is still outstanding. This is certainly no basic clothes for payment situation. The base game Hunter-mail looked so cool I ran it throughout the entire Campaign with it. That and you cannot play story missions with friends until after you watch a cutscene (then you could just quit mission and rejoin again with friends)

That's it. What are you waiting for? Buy the game. Be surprised by the detail, the game play,the graphics and the fun. Struggle on, Anjanath, Diablos and Rathalos. Turn them into sticks, Then come back here remember this review and make your own. 

TLDR: This is one of the greatest games I have ever played. It is constantly on sale and you should at least give it a try because it is worth full price I PROMISE you.",True,29056,26269,1721451817,1721452187,0,0

I played it back when it released on Console and had to buy it again when i moved to Pc.
The Thing i like the most about this game is very clearly its design.
The Monster Design is very cool and i like the new Monsters that got introduced in this Game.
My Favorite from the Main Game being the Nergigante.
The Weapons look absolutely stunning aswell.
Im a Longsword Main so i mostly only played Longswords, but my friends that i played with played with different weapons and i can say that the weapons they used looked very good everytime aswell.
The World Design is very good aswell, my favorite area from the main game was probably the Elders Recess

The Iceborne DLC was very Fun aswell and only made this Game better for me. 
All monsters introduced in this DLC were so cool to fight against with my Favorite Monster being the Glavenus.

The Armor Designs in both the Main Game and the DLC was just perfect to me.

Overall i would recommend this game to everyone.

76561198020954621,170108998,"The Good:
Fun game, if you can find a weapon you enjoy. 
At first I picked the insect glaive and I didn't enjoy the game. Also I played with the keyboard and mouse and it was horrible. Then I swapped to a PS4 contoller, started playing with the Long Sword, and my opinion did a 180° immediately. Also look up a guide on game settings, you can thank me later.
Awesome soundtrack and graphics.
Proper Anime Story.
Cool monster design. 
Varied locations.
Palicos and Grandmeowster.

The Bad:
The layered armor unlocks way too late.
Way too grindy for a Single-player game (While this is debatable It isn't an MMORPG for sure).
The pacing of the difficulty is all over the place. 
As in: 
You start vanilla with the defender armor that makes it too easy(this is optional you can farm through vanilla, but I already did once so for a second playthrough I used the defender till before Nergigante).
Then you get to Iceborne and have the floor mopped with you.
Then you get to Barioth and be like 'HOW?!'
Then you grind and then Velkhanna mops the floor with you.
Then you grind and then you realize that was just the appetizer, there's a proper Velkhanna fight.
Then you grind and finally finish the game, credits roll.
Then you get to the grinding lands and start farming zone levels and MR like you are playing an mmorpg.
Then Stygian Zinogre mops the floor with you.
Then Rajang mops the floor with you.
Then Raging Brachydios mops the floor with you.
Then you grind(probably Silver Rathalos for a 100 times) till MR100, to be able to finally 'Finish' the game for real this time and mop the floor with Ruiner Nergigante.
Then you wipe on Arch tempered Velkhana for a weekend straight.
Or you can just use the S.O.S Flare and trivialize it all. But then what's the point?

To be fair the difficulty isn't an issue in itself, and it feels cathartic to finally finish a challenging fight, the issue is with the pacing with the spikes in difficulty.

Even though iceborne was initially lacklustre, the constant updates when this game was being updated live continued to improve upon the game. Even though it has the classic japanese horrendous UI and KBM controls, i must recommend it. 

Unlike other boss-fighting games such as souls-like (which can be a comparison for the encounters this game has imo), this game is NOT trivialised when you use your entire toolkit. In this game using your entire toolkit doesnt make bosses free which is nice, and bosses (99% of them at least) feel very fair, and not overwhelmingly impossibly difficult since you have 3 lives, a little pet that holds aggro sometimes, and many consumables and tools to survive and fight in your own way.

The game's ecology is a wonder, the environments may not be 100% open world (game is more akin to lobby based  sectioned gameplay), but the areas and design truly are amazing and detailed. Great sound design, art, music. It's hard to say something bad about this game. 


The multiplayer aspect of the game in this version works very well (You can shoot an SOS and random people can join to help you out), which makes it single player but multiplayer if you feel like it. I will say though that sometimes the multiplayer just messes up with random DCs, but the vast majority of the time its smooth so i'll give a pass.


The decoration farming in the game (Basically how you farm passive ability jewels that you slot into your gear slots), is the worst part of this game by far, and may make you quit however. Its 100% pure rng, and you cannot target farm the exact jewel you need. This may  genuinely make or break the game for you i admit.

Let's get this out of the way:
This game is hard, grindy and clearly not for everyone.
but if you're the kind of player who is willing to spend tons of hours in this game and get over the hard fights and grinds...
THIS GAME IS THE BEST THING EVER!!!

The game goes like this: you embark on a quest to kill a monster in one of 6 maps, you have to prepare specially to deal with each monster, each hunt generally takes 15 minutes, and once you kill the monster, you get materials and money to craft better equipment and hunt stronger monsters. And it's a loop of this formula, however each hunt greatly varies depending on what monster you're hunting, the attacks the monster uses, where the monster goes, what other monsters are present in the map, what weapon you're using and how good you do in the hunt, which keeps it entertaining. Your success as a hunter will depend on how much you know about the monster, how good you're with your weapon, how good you are at dodging and reading attacks and what you can do with your enviroment.

While the beggining is...meh, it takes too long to get entertaining and may be very repetitive, but once you're on your somewhat 20th hour, you get REALLY hooked up.
It has straight up the best creature design ever, far beating pokemon, GOW or any other game out there. They feel alive and really add something special to the enviroment, and about that, The maps are incredible.
While they're kinda limited, they look amazing and each one if fully unique.
Now for the fighting system:
You have 14 DIFFERENT WEAPONS each one with their unique playstyle, and that's without talking about the different playstyles within each weapon. The option are huge. The moves are relatively slow, but they feel real and the animations are perfect. They did an amazing job balancing the weapons, since you can beat most monsters consistently with each one. You have bows, guns, swords, staffs, lances, hammers and crazy weapons like charge blade and switch axe, and each one of this have around 50 skins depending on what monster materials it's made out of, and most look really cool.
Each monster is almost completely different from the other (except for subspecies) and have unique mechanics that require for special objects to deal with.
The game has at least 200 hours of gameplay to keep you entertained and way more if you want to kill every monster  and as you progress, the bosses start to get hard, like, REALLY HARD, I'm talking about souls game dlc final boss difficulty and it will take some serious skill, practice and some of the best equipment to kill the final boss

Remember: this game isn't for anyone, it's only for people who like boss fights and a challenge so if you aren't the kind of gamer who likes these things, I'd save my money because you'll most likely not enjoy it, specially since there's no difficulty option. But if you do like this things, give it a try!

9.7/ 10


DLC : Iceborne



+ MASSIVE amount of contents without compromising their quality
+ Frequent free updates (the only paid ones are the cosmetic ones and nothing essentials)
+ G rank difficulty and more monster varieties
+ Monster and hunter movements are very fluid
+ Overall still feels like Monster Hunter, just very polished.

- Lazy weapon designs are still there even for additional monsters (not all, but still a good number of the new weapons are still the same bone/iron base slapped on with some monster parts, even when the monsters in question have unique weapon designs before (looking at you, Brach drumsticks!))
- The weapon creation/upgrade menu is still unnecessarily slow and convoluted, prefer back then (pre-world), it's far more simple and still gets the job done. Also i hate how they hide the stats of your next upgrades before you get the ""key"" material (which they also hide)

Notes: 
* Not a fan of the clutch claw and damage numbers, but eh, you can just not use those, so i don't really care. Besides, more options are always better.
* An option where you can choose whether you want to display the weapons' true or bloated raw and elements would be greatly appreciated.

76561198034589422,169894856,"[h2]Every reason I can think of to not play this game (Mostly nitpicks, but still):[/h2]


1: The first 20 hours of gameplay are a ""tutorial"", meaning everything is repeated to you constantly and they treat you like a child until you can access 6-star missions. This also makes the game feel like a bunch of buildup to nothing instead of a story. Because you're being handheld and over-trained the whole game it feels like it will open up eventually, then it ends.

2: T H E   H A N D L E R. This dumbass has enough neurons firing to be mistaken for a whale's heartbeat. Additionally, she feels so... plastic. Just basic, one-trick and annoying, And then you have YOUR character trying to save her the entire time, against your consent. Remind me, who's the 'handler' again?

3: Every time a hunt ends, you have 60 seconds to gather loot in the area before you're taken back to the Hub. [u]There is no vote to skip.[/u] You will sit on your pretty ass for 60 seconds until you can go home.

4: Long, unskippable cutscenes. 'nuff said.

5: This is a fighting game with material grinding. Every weapon is a different fighting style that will take time and practice to learn, not to mention all of the upgrades that can give affinity (Crit chance), elemental damage, durability levels, etc. Then you have to figure out what creatures you're supposed to hunt in order to get the materials to do so. Figuring out what weapon to use where, when and how is an entire half of your start.

6: You start with the two armor types based on resisting different elements, and ""Guardian"" armor. The Guard armor is designed for people who have the DLC to speedrun to it. This is alongside the easy to make ""Defender"" weapons which are a unique and linear upgrade path for every weapon. They have stupid damage and a bonus element that few monsters resist. These weapons and armor are basically an easy mode that you can access from the start. Honestly, the weird part is that they're base game and not included in the DLC.

7: You can pay upwards of 3.99 USD for BS cosmetics that you can't see. Typical stuff.

But after a lot of nagging from a friend I picked World and Iceborne up from a sale and was blown away by the detail and beauty of the game. The variety of weapons means that something will suit your playstyle, and the way they design different weapons from the same monster using different interpretations of its abilities is very cool. Even just observing the monsters as they traverse the world is interesting as each one uses the environment differently, there's a 5 hour documentary on youtube that covers the entire game's ecosystems and ecology that's fascinating to watch. Even my initial worry of the slow combat wasn't an issue due to how punchy each weapon is, the slowness is paid off by having big reactions from the monsters you hit having them recoil away from big attacks makes you feel like a real badass as you just play around with these huge creatures. The soundtrack and music can vary a little bit but you will notice the really good tracks when they play (looking at you zinogre). 96 hours in and still haven't hunted everything, looking forward to Safi'jiva, but it goes to show the quality and amount of stuff you can do, there's so much content but it never really feels to overwhelming so I always never mind just hopping on for a hunt or two when I'm bored.

76561198101543226,169727752,"ive given this game like five separate chances over the years and every time im reminded why i fucking hate it

do you enjoy games where you arent actually allowed to play it? do you like hobbling around with clunky controls that are unresponsive enough to make geriatrics feel like athletes in their prime? do you like spending ten minutes in combat, only to get third partied by a dipshit that drops bombs on you like you're a malaysian child? do you like the idea of trying to get an opening on your opponent for ten minutes straight, and when you finally get yourself in the perfect position to absolutely ruin it, it brushes against you or screeches which knocks you out of a combo and wastes the last 10 minutes of your life just so you can do it all again? do you like going on a mission, realising you dont have the consumables necessary to not just die after five minutes, so instead you have to go on a consumable collecting sidequest that takes twice as long as actually fighting the monster, and then having to do that every fucking time you wanna fight another monster because the last one needed you to use all of your resources just to kill it?

not only do i not recommend this game, i dont recommend Rise either, and im making a guess that Wilds isn't gonna be much better. this franchise is about as old as me, and THIS is the gameplay formula that everyone raves about? it took them fourteen years and ten releases to arrive at THIS? this game is the peak of type 3 fun - not fun in the slightest, neither in the moment nor in retrospect. i havent had any paid games removed from my account ever - until now.

and if you do actually enjoy this type of game, i wanna put you under a microscope and dissect you.",False,2725,2725,1720832352,1720832439,0,0

good game but the late game is just pain, at least for gun-lance. also they removed being able to blast wyverns out of the sky with the damned thing and that's the entire reason i picked gunlance in the first place. think i'll just play lance or bowgun in the next game. Gunlance is immobile and slow so when you have a big elder dragon doing attack that take it halfway into the next zip-code you have two options sheath and risk loosing half your health bar to an attack you are not use to using dodge-rolls to avoid because you play gunlance that doesn't use them and just blocks instead or slowly waddle over at which point the monster will attack something and end up half the zone away from you again. and that's assuming it isn't going to just one hit KO you with some beam regardless of your block.",True,12712,12291,1720829276,1721192290,0,0
