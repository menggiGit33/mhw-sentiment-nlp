76561198153018810,186359499,after playing through dragons dogma 2 and for whatever reason thinking the combat is perfect and reminds me of world maybe i should replay that cause i am enjoying dd2 so much i thought id play world once again to get all the items weapons equipment in other words 100 it in preparation for wilds it turns out those were some intensely rose tinted glasses cause the combat in dd2 feels lightyears ahead of world in terms of fluidity and fun i suppose the first time i played and platinumd mhw was in coop which the game is designed around and it makes everything exponentially faster and more fun but playing it solo genuinely one of the most clunky sluggish frustrating and repetitive games you can get your hands on relatively recent but has unskippable cutscenes and dialogue that is in a game where the narrative is clearly an afterthought at its best the handler has to be one of the most annoying characters in gaming terrible coop system that needs you to progress past the halfway point of missions to actually invite friends for said missions even from software coop is better than this the combat for actionrpg enjoyers that have played the souls games as well as elden ring i will try to sum up how it feels in world you are a dark souls 2 character in terms of clunk and slow controls but somehow it is made even slower and clunkier animations stagger lock even healing legit take 510 seconds to recover from barely any iframes all the while enemies you fight are like fire giants on crack that dash around constantly and half their attacks turn them into giant hitboxes one of the worst counterintuitive control schemes ive ever experienced you have to try it for yourself to fully understand the extent of how jumbled up and exhausting all the controls and ui feel if you dont want to try it well if you have seen those ubisoft memes where people take stills from different games and ironically copypaste 100s of ui elements on them to mimic mock ubisoft thats how mhw looks all the time unironically repetitive as hell tickle a monsters taint for 5 minutes while occasionally getting stunlocked boss decides it is time to run off to the other side of the map spend minutes traversing the convoluted maps with slow as snails movement boss is enraged now meaning the bullshit is dialed up to 11 repeat until monster is dead i have already mentioned it but everything is so damn slow stamina while running outside of combat in relatively huge and convoluted maps sheathing and unsheathing weapons takes ages and is a necessity to do constantly as characters refuse to sprint or pull other actions like heal with weapons unsheathed think of how a 100200h long game of exclusively that would be like thats monster hunter world in a nutshell fanboys of the series take on calling it slow and methodical in reality it is just tolerated because 1 coop mhw is designed around it that mechanic alleviates the majority of the issues this game has especially combat issues as even 1 additional player their calico can bring a ton of breathing room into the fight by pulling aggro and 2 people that have been conditioned through years and several mh titles to believe this is what good game design is like truly the blue cheese of video gaming all in all this is a game for coop first and foremost an incredibly bland repetitive and frustrating boss rush experience for solo play absolutely not recommended for solo play dont get caught up in the hype and the positive reviews you will have an awful time however if you want to buy it for coop i do recommend it,False,18041,18041

76561198392578274,186305523,my love for the monster hunter series is a long and storied one it all started with monster hunter 4 and generations on my nintendo 3ds games that were so compelling they were the sole reason i purchased the console the switch followed of course driven by the allure of rise and now thanks to my steam deck ive finally experienced the sprawling world of monster hunter world and its been nothing short of amazing from the start i was captivated as a lifelong fan of dragons the sheer variety and power of the elder dragons in world was a dream come true facing these majestic beasts utilizing the environment to my advantage was a thrilling experience the core gameplay loop hunting monsters crafting powerful armor and weapons from their remains and then using that enhanced power to hunt even greater beasts is incredibly immersive the sense of progression is satisfying and deeply rewarding what truly sets world apart for me is its grounded realistic approach to the monsters and their ecosystem the way the monsters interact with their environment the subtle details of their behavior and the ability to use the surroundings to my advantage in combat felt incredibly immersive and believable this realistic approach combined with the stunning visuals elevates the combat to a new level even if the pace is slower than previous entries in the series the tradeoff is well worth it for the visual spectacle and the visceral impact of each attack i primarily focused on the longsword and dual blades drawn to their elegant yet powerful movesets the satisfying shing of the longsword and the lightningfast strikes of the dual blades perfectly complemented my play style the cute palicos always ready with a timely attack or a humorous animation added a touch of levity to the intense hunts while other monster hunter games have their own unique charms worlds more realistic and visually impressive approach to the monsters and their hunting grounds truly resonated with me its a testament to the series enduring appeal a game that consistently delivers thrilling hunts rewarding gameplay and a deep sense of accomplishment playing it on my steam deck only enhanced the experience offering the perfect blend of portability and immersive gameplay monster hunter world is without a doubt a highlight of my gaming journey,True,5426,5426

76561198088775807,186106979,the only real complaint is some of the monster attack hitboxes being laughably bad but thats very rare fatalis has a lot of them but really the only other ones i can think of is whenever a monster dashes and it will catch you when you are behind them and not touching them at all its also possible to be cc locked or true combod but i dont really feel cheated when that happens since 90 of the time that comes from a missplay or missposition id also say alatreon is a really easy fight with an annoying gimmick i do think the explosion circle is a cool move and so is the headbutt since they both give opportunities to punish however the arena walls and rest of the fight is not great in contrast fatalis actually feels like a real fight and challenge even if he has some light siege elements i wouldnt even bring it up if it wasnt one of the final bosses nothing is as bad as the ff14 crossover boss on extreme though and i love ff14 anyways i love this game its amazing i understand how people can sink 3k hours into this alone and have been playing the franchise for decades i like worlds weighty and less arcadey gameplay style more than something like rise but thats looking at rise as a comparison as a monhun game when its also a great game still oh also some stabs and explosions and slams from monsters have lingering hitboxes for some weird and unknown reason which makes no sense and is very dumb an explosion shouldnt linger and a stab also shouldnt linger and damage you its possible to roll with iframes through these things and get hit anyways like with sidesteps on a lance small thing since you can always get away from them i just find it stupid i think that covers every complaint i have which only affected like maybe 15 of my entire playtime and only 5 of it was actually a negative experience all that said alatreon is a horribly designed monster and they should never do anything like it ever again i dont think we need to worry about that i just wanted to state the obvious in case it wasnt clear since i actually like some aspects of alatreon,True,17317,16487

76561199151519276,185957645,boy i sure love monster hunter world since everyone says this one is the best of series after all i expecially love love how there is lots of detail and realism at the trade of everything looking washed out and hard to see that the game needs to have little yellow paint scout flies letting you know what you can interact with not to mention boring all the weapons look generic and dont reflect the monsters that the weapon is made out of love how the game is constantly reminding you of basic things and said wisps are always telling you what to do and what to interact with and where the monster is your ugly helper never goes away and stops telling you the obvious either love how the maps are huge and that hunts revolve around looking for tracks droped randomly that are mandatory to collect for the monster to even spawn in and god forbid you need to unlock the monster first and once you do finally get enough scooby doo clues the fights are mostly it running away and you chasing it down over the length of a entire state making hunts take way longer than needed but the throwabl shut up love how the tutorial is nearly 2hrs long and somehow still manages to teach you barely anything of note just like the only monster hunters except those were 5 mins long if they even had one also the tutorial ends with a pop up letting you know theres micro transactions that you still havent bought which always leaves such a good taste in my mouth when the game i just bought is asking me for more money love the limited availability of certain quests for the sole purpose of artificially padding out the grind keeping you in the hamster wheel since world tries to be a live service game with limited time events quests and daily login bonuses which thankfully none of which is still maintained but you can just ignore that i can now cause im playing this game years after support for it was dropped so all the predatory tricks to keep you playing dont work anymore and thankfully capcom released a update that lets you play and event quest at any time wilds without a doubt will repeat all the same practices as world doubly so since capcom has gotten more and more comfortable with bs micro transactions in their games even their single player ones which will guarantee i wont be picking it up until the next mainline monster hunter is annonced and all the annoying crap is removed from the game and how the game is now pretty much exclusively multiplayer even though due to the abundance of cutscenes if its the first time doing that quest your friends have to wait until you watch the cutscene revealing the monster or whatever it might be before they get to join leading to a very start and stop multiplayer experience so if your tagging along with a friend going throw his main quests you get scroll on social media for a few minutes before joining oh and because its multiplayer only no pause button even if your playing alone in the game with the longest most drawn out hunts in the series admittedly the monster turf war mechanic is pretty cool at first after you see it half a dozen times though it becomes annoying and breaks up a hunt thats already pretty start and stop as is this mechanic went on to become pretty cool in rise letting you ride and control the monster to fight the other kaiju style but in world the clutch claw and turf wars are janky and mondo pace breakers so as you can see its clear why world is the best selling monster hunter to date cause its just sooooooo good cause popular means good after all and if you dont see it that way its cause of skill issue and you dont get monster hunter and dont like having fun,False,463,407
76561199188254846,185957286,despite its stunning graphics beautiful monster designs and impressive environments monster hunter world left me frustrated for several reasons as someone coming from sekiro and elden ring i found the games approach to player onboarding excessive the tutorial section drags on unnecessarily long filled with slowloading cutscenes and endless menu explanations the user experience also proved challenging the hud is cluttered with information and difficult to navigate the combat particularly in early encounters feels repetitive and lacks the skill progression i expected even basic monster fights require an excessive number of hits and without a visible health bar theres no sense of progress during these lengthy encounters what particularly disappointed me was the games heavy reliance on rng mechanics for item drops and equipment forging especially in a fullpriced game for 8 i expected a more streamlined progression system rather than being forced to grind repeatedly for materials freetoplay games like genshin impact offer more straightforward advancement systems while monster hunter world excels in visual presentation the actual gameplay experience failed to capture my interest the combination of tedious tutorials unclear combat feedback and rngdependent progression made it difficult for me to enjoy the game despite its beautiful aesthetic qualities,False,129,129

76561198143464272,185919354,first off im biased i love slow but thoughtful combat systems the game can be difficult but gives you plenty of time and optional quests to gather resources and experience its not a game to rush through at least not in my opinion i have 40 hours in my current save and this is the farthest ive gotten in the main story apparently im only half way thats not counting end game content or iceborn it has a lot to offer a lot of terrifying monsters to fight a lot of cool armor to wear a decent amount of awesome weapons to discover it has been a treat so far im excited to play through the rest of it,True,8401,6799

76561198059637999,185917073,i love the game but strongly recommend you get the cutscene skip mod if you started with rise or wilds for posteritys sake also be prepared to mash your continue dialog button when talking to any npc including the smithy argosy etc because they never shut up and repeat the same 2 or 3 lines of dialog incessantly still looks good still runs good character customization is a little underwhelming compared to rise a lot of the weapons youve got access to are severely underwhelming visually speaking at first thanks dev team they all suck visually but they eventually get pretty kickass has multiple fun elder dragons you cant fight in rise and will likely never return in future titles,True,11545,10957

76561197963365886,185881425,the worldbuilding is phenomenal the combat and weapons are fantastic and the monsters themselves are often aweinspiring i absolutely loved these aspects what didnt work for me time spent in menus i spent about onethird of my time organizing inventory crafting itemsarmor reading notes and upgrading equipment another third was spent mostly being lost while trying to hunt and only the remaining third was actually fighting monsters ideally id prefer a ratio more like 110 in menus 310 exploring and 610 in combat coop experience i really wanted to play this with my coop partner it seemed like the perfect game for us but the experience was ultimately incredibly frustrating the clunky mechanics for progressing through the story in coop mode often having to play through missions basically twice eventually made us stop playing together ive heard this improves significantly in iceborne but we didnt make it that far also a small issue but when monsters started whimpering and limping away my wife felt sorry for them and didnt want to hunt anymore the game never made it clear why we were killing these creatures so unless they looked like a t rex trying to eat us it started to feel like we were the villains somehow between the clunky coop and the limping we eventually stopped wanting to logon to progress final thoughts on paper this game seems perfectly designed for me possibly even one of the greatest of all time but the issues above got in the way of enjoying the game and we couldnt slog through it to reach what seems like the good stuff i do recommend this game but i think worlds story should really should be played through as a single player experience first maybe with some help occasionally from other players if needed on a hard monster,True,3354,3354

76561198320679604,185748283,after playing across platforms for years its hard not to praise the flawless transition from oldgen mh to worldborne the game features an amazing combat system and the change to how abilities work truly fuels creativity in how you build your hunter all while keeping things stylish and functional the environments and visuals are breathtaking with unique creatures that you can either collect or simply admirebecause why not the amount of content not only in base game is enough to keep you hooked for months whether youre grinding for monster parts farming decorations or teaming up with players worldwide to tackle raid monsters and seasonal events the mh team did a wonderful job on this game and it is well worth the buy,True,15277,15277

76561198124191400,185744968,510 world and iceborne share the same rating world decided that it would make decorations randomized decorations are the pieces that complete a build of course so if you happen to be unlucky and never get the good decorations no matter how much melding and farming you make some fights are just straight up inconvenient to do for most of the game you are forced to play suboptimally until you get lucky enough to get things like weakness exploit expert or critical boost decorations that really give a build the oomph it needs to win a fight that or you do have those decorations but you dont have the utility skills like razor sharp or protective polish because you never got the decos for them then there are the rng rewards fuck the rng rewards if i carve a tail i want to get a tail i should not randomly get some dumbass scale or some other thing that can be found elsewhere on the monster for some monsters tails are hard to cut or break especially if you didnt get the partbreaker deco in the rng decoration grind the scoutflies are retarded sometimes i have to disable and enable a waypoint just because they stopped working or sent me the long way around a destination the weapons are a disaster theyre just slapon monster parts on templates the armors are a mixed bag ranging from nice to butt ugly as for the fight against the monsters themselves the game relies on difficulty via amazing ranges or wide area of effects of course the game suffers from skill parring you need at least 1 evade extender decoration to make the dodge feel decent in distance lord knows how many evade window decos it takes to make the dodge feel good in iframes because i still dont have them no matter how many of those dumb jagras event quests i do when you finally beat shara ishvalda you feel less elated and more glad that its over but its not over of course this title has an endgame that doesnt know how to end filled to the brim with boss fights that even at the games best the hunter is forever illequipped for ive played mhfu and the transition to mhw made all the good changes except for where it mattered most the game is still plagued with low drop rate rng bullshit plagued with a lifeless village with people pretending that theyve been working with you when all theyve done is bark orders and make you do the heavy lifting world pretends it has a good story around a settlement working together to survive but the npcs cant be bothered to fire cannons themselves and they still make you pull the dragonator lever when someone else could have literally done that there are lots of tidbits about monster ecology that could have been good to leverage in gameplay but they just windup as setdressing it makes the game look alive but feel dead at the end of the day the ecology knowledge has no bearing on your ability to hunt monsters it matters little that barroth eats ants or that pukeipukei eats shrooms these are never leveraged enough in gameplay that theres so much wasted opportunity for actual interesting quests world is a large stepup from mhfu but its easy to make a large step away from a disaster so far monster hunter risesunbreak is the only game that has successfully distanced itself from the tedium of the old if you want a truly modern mh skip this and buy risesunbreak rise is a bit bland but the sunbreak expansion is a vast improvement from worldiceborne i suggest skip this game or wait for mh wilds though im certain that mh wilds will take a lot of cues from world for the worse,False,15345,11500

76561198070846161,185739609,tldr the game feels like work and the more i play the less i like it mostly because im fighting the controls instead of the monsters im done i get why ppl can like the game but the more i play the less i actually enjoy the game it feels like work instead of a game and as monsters get harder it feels less and less as if im actually fighting the monster and more that im fighting the clunky controls as i said i can understand why ppl like it and if youre willing to work and probably suffer for it you likely can get a wonderful experience but this is worse than dark souls to learn in dark souls your character reacts when you push a button in this game in fights i had a 60 chance that my character would react when i pushed a button because of various stuff from waiting until your character finished an uninterruptable animation to having a monster chain roar while not having the perk equipped to not get stunned from roars i cant talk about the multiplayer experience since i play solo but i think its possible that much of my frustration wouldnt apply since you probably can trade aggro with other ppl instead of some cats so you wouldnt have to fight your controls as much,False,5551,5551

76561199004938000,185631337,tldr if you like gameplayfocused games grinding and beating large monsters with cool weapons youll love this game i love this game this is one of the best gameplayfocused games ive ever played i always prioritize fun gameplay over story or graphics in a game and if youre like me you should give this game a try in my opinion the story and graphics are just okay i dont really care about them but i thought it was worth mentioning i saw the story more as a tutorial for the main game youll learn the basics of hunting and using weapons through the story missions and the game truly opens up after you finish the story you can also play coop for most of the story quests i say most because in some instances youll need to finish the first phase of a monster fight before you can call for support the game isnt perfect though ive experienced random server disconnections and occasional crashes and if youre an achievement hunter youll need to pray to rngesus because many achievements are tied to rng if you have patience and plenty of time youll be fine there are 14 weapons in the game so youll definitely find one that suits your playstyle i main the switch axe aka swaxe and absolutely love it but im also trying to learn the bow as it will help me with the basics when i play monster hunter wilds oh and by the way when buying the game make sure to get the master edition so youll have access to the dlc if you didnt know when the dlc was released some mechanics were rebalanced and they actually nerfed the base game so if you dont have the dlc you might notice these changes in conclusion monster hunter world is an amazing game with insane gameplay from the intense battles against massive monsters to the wide variety of weapons and playstyles its a game that keeps you coming back for more and i love the community whether youre a seasoned hunter or new to the series this game offers something truly special,True,38946,37801

76561199153265321,185566914,okay guys i get it let me get you some pros insight between world and rise rise is simplified monster hunter experience with a focus of the combat actions between hunters and monster less hp wirebug is quitesimilar to clutch claw and tons of switch skills to try on meanwhile world is an immersive world where we do things manually less monster hp more into the gathering preparations tracking then huntingcapturing the monster yea its all about process world is my favorite in terms of gameplay but combat is quite fast and yeah they actually give some extra in the slowmo scene where you land your final hit after mounting monster its pretty tough using clutch claw because i played rise first i love meowscular chef overall would love to see monster hunter wilds soon im new into monster hunting but been looking a lot of videos of old monster hunter gameplay 3 no hate comments just personal opinion happy gaming yall,True,6072,1236

76561197967525009,185558294,ive got a few hundred hours on the ps4 version and the ps5 bought it on sale forever ago and finally giving it a whirl on the pc plays and looks great thats for sure however i still think this game was made to be used with a controller a bit more than km controls its fine but it doesnt seem as fluid as the console version tbh maybe im just more used to it due to my time on that console playing the game anyway game looks amazing on pc plays amazing on pc and has unlocked framerates with dlss and just runs awesome ive forgotten a lot since i last touched the game and its fun relearning everything from scratch again good times also i will say the sound is a lot better if you have your pc hooked up to any kind of 51 or 71 system or cans sound is actually done really good for the pc version seems to be a lot better than running the 51 or 71 for the console could be a console limitation as well meh i will say this though try to get the monster hunter world complete edition if ever possible possibly on sale that will include the main game iceborne and all the smaller dlcs that they want to nickel and dime you to death with dlc is actually pretty ridiculous but to each their own its all cosmetic anyway ill be playing this for the next couple of months though mh wilds while fun in the beta just has a ton of issues and i think theyll be hard pressed to fix all the issues before launch ill probably give wilds a couple of months to cook and get patched and then dive into later knowing me i probably wont wait though ooooh shiny new game,True,1348,1348

76561199204533738,185551932,one of the better monster hunter games from a gameplay presentation and graphical perspective as an old school mh fan there are some changes that i think the series needed that maybe didnt click with me for a while the maps are dense and incredibly deep to explore but sometimes make for cramped lame places to fight the monsters mainly looking at the ancient forest and the one bone swamp map as other maps are very fun to fight monsters on some of the weapon changes are improvements though they turned my longsword from a combo king to a counter king which makes it much less fun of a weapon for me weapon designs leave a lot to be desired in the base game and monster designs are pretty good but i think not quite as strong as other mh games despite my longsword complaint this game has near peak combat mechanics in all of video games multiplayer is very flawed in this game though and is a major downgrade from most mh games dating back to the wii era a wii game had better multiplayer than this crazy but just the truth playing with friends can often be a major chore it is not as simple as join your friends lobby and do quests together there are awful shenanigans with cutscenes which force players to play solo even when in a multiplayer lobby if they want to both progress the game its quite honestly a hot mess all in all a great entry in the series particularly if playing solo and imo a necessary step that has some growing pains out of old school mh but is held back by poor weapon design and highly disappointing multiplayer lobbying even so this is a solid recommendation from me for mh fans action game fans and fans of cool monster designs i found that despite the bad multiplayer it was still worth playing with friends just because monster hunter at its core is that great i personally prefer generations mh4u and rise to world but that could be nostalgia,True,2718,2709

76561198154564712,185544910,great game but there is one major issue i cant pause the game i understand its online how it supposed to be multiplayer game put in private sessions i should be allowed to pause sometimes you got to use the washroom i personally hate the clutch claw mechanic as it intrusive gameplay mechanic that becomes necessary if you want a quicker hunt previous mh games never had it didnt need it i enjoy the indepth equipment customization and stats but if accidentally overlook something it causes me to suffer in gameplay cant recommend it as a casual game due to the indepth mechanics you need to learn,True,9036,9036

76561198050229973,185488364,i do not recommend this game specifically for coop because they force story quests to be played on single player until all cutscenes have been encountered and storybased expeditions can only be played solo the only parts of the game you can reliably play entirely with others are optional side quests it makes playing through the main game on coop really frustrating since you have to leave and rejoin quests at unknown points because you never know whats going to trigger a cutscene it completely kills momentum having to sync up with other coop players for what seems like an artificial limitation the worst part is the game doesnt communicate these limitations well for example it explicitly prompts for a party size when beginning a story quest but then forces the party size to be 1 any way without any feedback as to why i had to search online to figure out why that was happening another major issue i have is the keyboard and mouse controls they feel really off especially menu navigation and the keys used for unrelated functions change depending on whether your loadout is melee or ranged i had to switch to a gamepad because the keyboard and mouse controls were too awkward it was clearly designed for console inputs first and foremost its unfortunate because otherwise i think the core gameplay is solid if grindy the world is interesting and the environments are beautiful there is a lot of content to explore but its hampered by some poor design choices,False,3829,3330

76561198245849838,185436902,one step forward two steps back this is in most terms an incredible game you can feel the passion of the developers oozing out of every aspect of it but as a classic monster hunter fan many of the design changes feel very questionable and i cant shake off the feeling that the older games that are sadly not on pc are just overall more cohesive games anyway the gameplay loop for all these games is basically a mix of wandering through nature in peace and then fighting some of the best bossfights in videogames for like 20 minutes straight then you have a town where you craft stuff and all that if you like the idea of doing that for a hundred hours then this franchise is for you also if you cant decide between world and rise let me pick for you play this one ignore rise pretend it doesnt exist,True,1027,1027

76561198036652431,185245359,hoo boy this is a review thats gonna take some thought alright well see how this goes btldrb my overall thoughts on monster hunter are positive it is absolutely a fantastic game however there are some serious caveats that i think need to be addressed if youre willing to work around those caveats youll find this game to be 100 worth the money and then some especially if you get and its expansion on sale h2prosh2 dense beautifully crafted hub worlds and levels filled with loot secrets and environmental hazards that can both help andor hurt you when fighting one of my concerns with the upcoming monster hunter wilds game is that the large open worlds that theyve created at least when i played the beta felt emptier than the levels in this game the story while relatively simple really nails down the feeling of adventure and exploring someplace new spoiler youre a member of an expedition team mapping out new regions and investigating the wildlife while protecting human interests and avoiding the ruination of the expedition team this was one of the games where i followed a lot of the cutscenes because the whole story was justfun the creatures and npc behavior in the various environments is incredible all the awesome interactions between creatures and the environment makes things feel like a realistic ecosystem that the creatures inhabit monsters have territories that they fight over they prey on smaller creatures they have routines that can be used against them its great the combat once you get used to it is incredibly engaging making fights against tough monsters feel intense and weighty the sheer variety of gear and cosmetics would make a fashion designer salivate the game is enjoyable in singleplayer but theres just something so great about the multiplayer sos system some people argue that multiplayer ruins the difficulty of the game but i disagree its so cool to be able to call for help and have people drop into your session showing off all their cool gear and tactics while taking on a threat the same goes for you showing up to help out others the community is mostly pretty supportive and youll see max level players helping out newbies in quests all the time my experience with the expansion which has mixed reviews mostly related to changes in how combat works with a tool called the clutch claw was almost completely positive but i can understand where people are coming from when they say they dont like it the amount of content it adds however pretty much stacks a whole new game on top of an already stacked older game giving tons of hours of new environments monsters and more h2consh2 first off this game is a grind ive heard people call the game an mmolite which makes sense ive done two playthroughs of the game with different weapons the first playthrough took me 40 hours and made it through the base game to the end of the story with a small amount of followup on the postgame content during that playthrough i never really understood how people could continue playing after the main story was beaten sure there was loads of endgame content but a lot of it felt like fluff tacked on to give people something to do the second playthrough which took 200 hours over the course of a few months happened under unique circumstances the current job that i work at gives me a massive amount of independence and i often have a lot of free time i also have a friend with unique circumstances that allowed us to play through the game together pretty frequently and i think that benefitted the 2nd playthrough immensely together we went through the whole main story and then later bought the expansion during a sale and played through almost all of that before burnout finally hit the both of us and we moved on to new games we were able to really dive deep into the various rpg systems and buildcrafting because we could afford to sink time into it for us it was a fantastic game that we sunk time into because we had the ability to but not everyone has that luxury second the ui menu systems combat control schemes and various crafting and upgrading systems can be very daunting there are things that i wish the game had changed with regards to its control schemes and menus to simplify navigation sure i got used to it but not everyone can deal with it once again it will take time to understand and learn how to navigate thankfully there are mods that can fix some of the various issues that people have with the game i highly encourage checking them out if you find the game to be too overwhelming or not quite what you want from it if id had some of the mods for my first playthrough i probably would have played longer but second times the charm if youre able to get over the hurdles and learning curve required to understand and play the game youll find an incredibly fun immersive actionrpg with a fantastic world and loads of content to explore theres a reason why this game is still popular many years after its initial release if i recall correctly its still in the steam top 100 games being played today h3810 game for me 910 with mods to improve the

76561198218135380,185217400,playing this game really makes you feel like a hunter in the wild this game makes grinding always fun and never repetitive you will become the apex predator in the food chain one monster part after another the gameplay requires both a personal skill increase and optimization of the equipment with a rewarding feeling that keeps you wanting more of it with 12 different weapons and combat styles to choose from you will for sure find one that suits your gaming style its very long and rich of content but the always different monsters and settings never let you get bored of it after hundreds of hours and all the monsters felled many times i feel at home with my weapon in hand so its a game i still like to come back to when i want a familiar challenge,True,25792,25318
76561198099821749,185214929,this was my introduction to the series and i bought it way after support for it concluded i didnt really reach the very end game of this game but i played enough to recommend it the gameplay loop is very simple 1 you prepare for a hunt 2 you hunt monsters 3 then you use the materials from the monsters you hunt to get better gear to hunt stronger monsters rinse and repeat everything outside of the hunt has its own fun but the meat and bones of the game lies in it mastering your weapon learning how each monster attacks knowing what equipment and items to bring these all make the game so interesting and so fun my only quibble with the game was how daunting the multiplayer aspect of this is at least when going through the story you had to watch the cutscenes separately then everyone except for the host has to leave the hunt and rejoin it it was very annoying to do that for every single time we tackled a hunt for the first time nonetheless this is only a problem during the main story and i believe theres no issues at all anywhere else i 100 would recommend this game for anyone who wants a thrilling bossbattler to sink their time into,True,7095,7095
76561197965293310,185214515,the best game in the series as far as im concerned and ive played since the first game came out on the ps2 the game has the best combat the series has ever seen the hits feel weighty and though some may say the combat is slow i dont see that as a bad thing theres plenty of intricacies and different skill levels available for most weapons and any weapon in competent hands can clear every challenge the game has to offer though it never stops feeling challenging the games pacing is fantastic and is balanced well for every new tier and of course at certain times throughout the game youll hit roadblocks with certain enemies and the answer is to delve into the deeper mechanics of your chosen weapon and learn to take every advantage the game offers you which means everything from equipment traps and environmental features i tried monster hunter rise and quit playing very quickly since the game pales in comparison in every regard still having high hopes for mh wilds though hopefullt itll be more like world than rise,True,26540,25916

76561198013158726,185200768,a fairly wellmade game no doubt but im just not a fan of the gameplay loop you essentially hunt predetermined monsters using scoutflies to detect their location and when you find the creature battle it for ten minutes then chase it to a new location fight for another ten minutes chase it to another location and then fight it once more until you kill it rinse and repeat the combat feels really clunky with a really noticeable input delay and the controls themselves just feel strange with some odd button mapping theres plenty of varied weapons and items to loot but essentially this game is just a boss fight simulator with huge demands for endurance rather than skill some of the bosses are really welldesigned and the fights start off fun but can then become exhausting especially when they last so long i can see why people enjoy this especially if you are into grindy games and have lot of spare time for a session but for me it was repetitive boring and predictable story is also rather bland and playing a mute character just makes it feel like everyone is talking at you the interface is also extremely horrible and needlessly convoluted which makes using features outside of battle incredibly frustrating too,False,371,371

76561198387959306,185132127,the game is great but only after you get used to the combat which is much more realistic than in other rpgs here the hero is not able to make 30 cuts in a few seconds with a giant axe but much less because weapon weighs its own weight when it comes to hunting the beast itself i feel a similar vibe here as in the witcher you have to track it down before you start the actual fight the graphics are phenomenal considering the year of release especially after installing additional mods and texture extensions that can be downloaded on steam i have almost 100 hours and i definitely recommend this game at the moment ive only played with one weapon insect glaive which i recommend if you like having a lot of mobility in combat im going to try some others,True,6178,5452

76561198822987469,185083991,i am by no means the best at this game however as someone coming from rise i thought that this game at first was super fun i enjoyed relearning how to fight in combat with the use of the slinger and having to actually dodge instead of using wirebug spam to make my way through each fight during low and high rank was not a single issue yeah the slinger wasnt exactly designed for the base game but it was still extremely cool master rank at first was the same with nothing really being different the same old grind set of fighting monsters and then making armor to then go fight other monsters just like monster hunter should be then the difficultly spiked to playing a dark souls for no logical reason i did not sign up to play this game in order to attempt a dark souls boss i signed up to hunt funny monsters and have a fun time with friends alatreon however spikes the difficulty out of no where with no warning if the game before this point had a more gradual increase in difficulty this wouldnt be such an issue however that is not the case for alatreon you have to memorize every single one of his moves to have a chance at beating him it also doesnt help that when you try to do the running dodge in game to avoid the damage instead the game just preforms a roll dodge instead and you die on top of this his mechanic of elemental damage threshold having to be met if not you get instantly killed is only cool on paper but is horrible to play against it also doesnt help even if you do meet that threshold then you have to have enough speed eating to still live through it this fights difficulty only exists to extend gameplay hours and there is nothing before it to help prepare the player for the difficulty spike if this monster makes a return in monster hunter wilds i would much rather just go fight amutsu with only kunai then have to fight this monster again,False,5888,5852

76561198383384236,185050597,this is at least to me probably the worst game in the franchise enemies can combo the user to basically guarantee fainting healing and cleansing take several seconds during which you can be attacked again to exacerbate the problem presented by excessive application of damageovertime effects monsters can kill you outright within a couple hits monsters can knock you down and you have to stupidly mash the w key to have the common sense to stand up and monsters can stun you which leaves you standing but you again still have to stupidly mash the w key to have the common sense to not just stand there like a target dummy the mechanics of battle are just simply completely ridiculous to the point that it isnt even fun if id had a demo of this game i wouldnt have bought it even with the special event armour it just doesnt compensate for the atrocious battle mechanics that are so stupid they render it entirely impossible to enjoy ive played other monster hunter games such as tri and loved them it was about skill and learning tricks techniques to overcome impressive monsters who didnt have excessively high hp with you spending 30 minutes fighting them with more than half of it spent either dodging or reloadingresharpening your weapon because you would ordinarily have enough ammunition to kill any one large monster if you were using the ranged weapons and it was rare to have to resharpen your weapon once much less 1020 times in one large monster fight during which you can still be attacked and it will throw you through the air without even the courtesy of autofinishing the resharpening because your eversoadorable palico cant happen to keep the things attention for 3 seconds while you resharp your weapon for the 23rd time its honestly like they conspired to make the game as unenjoyable as possible stacking up as many annoying and ridiculous mechanics and shortcomings as possible to ensure very few people would actually have the stamina which at least doesnt run out in 2 seconds like it does in far cry primals survivor mode to get to the later game where you might get gear thats actually worth having id almost say id be more effective in these fights running around without armour on but there doesnt seem to be a difference in how quickly you die with or without armour or how agile you are with big bulky heavy metal armour or excessively fluffy armour or skimpy leather as an aesthetic observation the armours also bloody ugly and the layered option for aesthetic armour application is just the super ugly armour in another equally unflattering colour which means that while youve got a good number of options for designing how your character looks it wont matter because theyll be buried under armour thats not only hideous but functionally useless anyway,False,1959,1842
76561198000704556,185047813,i did not purchase this game for the price of any sandwiches a friend gifted this to me so we could all play together in a group i enjoyed our time with it very much a fun with friends but looking back i dont know if i would want to come back to play more its heavy to extreme levels of grindy 2 other friends helped split the workload to mostly acceptable levels and its not an intuitive game system with little to no tutorials its a very muck about and find out approach to figure out the learning curve andor your preferred weapon type if youre willing to make heavy use of a wikiwalkthough but that always feels like cheating doesnt it i thought we had beat the game but in retrospect we got the the halfway mark in the story and said good enough steam db says this goes on sale for 13 regularly i think it is absolutely worth that price if you have the free time to sink into it i liked the idea of this game the craftingprogression system is a game mechanic that on paper really tickles my pickle but the late game grind was ultimately is why i only played halfway through in practice the reason we used the wiki so much is the information is added to your game only after you kill the monsters multiple times if youve killed them that much you probably dont need the trickstips so while it makes sense it sucks that it provides you help after you no longer need it,True,2689,2689

76561198168369779,184933413,for the tldr crowd if youve never played mh before this is an okay place to start especially if your friends are also playing it i would suggest rise more tho if youre coming here from rise or late from 3u4u i would suggest you temper your expectations a bit before making a purchase for those who want something more in depth i played this game when it came out on ps4 i was excited though i had my concerns as it seemed a little soon to release playing through it even back then i found it cosy at best but also a little boring in fact theres a lot of factors i can see now that hampered my enjoyment of this game compared to previous entries that id played im going to be comparing this game a lot to past entries for the purpose of highlighting why i think world was an overall downgrade i will throw rise in there for comparison also to highlight other details for one the new features are underwhelming sure the game has had a graphical upgrade its filled to the brim with clutter and maximalism that wasnt possible on the 3ds but the gameplay mechanics comparatively are not exciting from a gameplay perspective most of worlds changes are quality of life potions are now crafted on the fly you dont need blue mushrooms to make em no stock of pickaxes and bug nets cinematic travel bits monsters can smash parts of the environment to new effects this isnt especially new the game is overall easier and so on compare these changes with monster hunter 3 ultimate with its underwater combat iffy in execution but unique alongside the introduction of the switch axe the difficulty was toned down for its own reasons but it had good qualities 4 ultimate added verticallity to the land and coupled that with difficult to perform and continue mounting monsters as well as adding two new weapons the insect glaive and the charge blade not to mention 4 ultimate had one of if not the biggest number of monsters of mainline monster hunter even if you dial back to 4 vanilla only few are not a part of that roster and this isnt even factoring in the number of weapons frenzy virus mechanics visual effects caused by gore magala when enraged and so on 4u did so much and while i understand that world cant fully be blamed for having less i cant help but think this was all intentional withdrawal its clear they wanted to attract a new audience though i doubt they expected nearly the amount of traffic they got reducing the amount in the game makes it seem fresher to a new audience and can make it easier to raise the stakes for whatever game that comes next ive seen it a million times over conspiracy theories aside world is genuinely disappointing because not only is the roster of monsters lower with generally the same core gameplay but the game hides even more of its roster behind paid dlc why is this a bad thing because monster hunter 4 ultimate had a smorgasbord of dlc collabs mechanics and stuff that was all free none of it was paid this was true of generations ultimate too whats more you could download it and do it anytime there was no restrictions that forced you to allot it within a certain time frame like world does thankfully rise revised this issue i will also say and i know many will disagree with me on this the overall qol improvements in my opinion hurt monster hunters gameplay identity there was a reason you couldnt move while using a potion before it was a risk and you had to learn the timing of it there was a reason you had stiff decisive attacks you couldnt easily back out of once again risk and decisive gameplay while im grateful for the removal of hot and cool drinks bug nets and pickaxes as well as items you bring on the quest in limited stock forced you to think having a safety net of items removes the disappointment of forgetting them but it fits with the whole vibe of being prepared for the hunt which cannot be overlooked in ways i think streamlining this was good for accessibility but harmful for the core gameplay from an expression perspective now you may suggest well just pretend you have limited use for the bug nets or dont move with a potion and those would work if it actually kept the vibe alive i dont feel like i have to prepare for bug nets because there is no preparation and the game is built around the player moving with a potion i cant really play the classic way and get away with it besides i find the logic of having to gimp yourself inhibits the experience of yknow being a hunter jumping into the bowels of danger upon revisiting the game i learned once again how bad the ancient forest is especially as a first map in the game the added layers the overusage of clutter which obscures items which if it bothers me imagine how that is for the visually impaired other maps in the game are generally fine i have no major issue with the others ironically while i find the rotten vale the least visually interesting to look at due to mindless clutter the spaces actually feel spacious which is nice once again the added mechanics and tuning of them are underwhelming and lend themselves to easing the experience up a lot the emergence of world and its usage like poisonous plants to create puddles to affect foes tricking em into a dam that can unleash water knocking em down those are really cool but i feel they take partially away from the zen feeling of hunting a monster the one on one learning patterns mastering them its still there but with so many options to give you the upper hand i find it undermines that approach to mastery slinger ammo is another easy ailments easy stun easy damage i can spitball a monster and suddenly the danger is lessened mantles are similar another tool to ease the gameplay up stealth mechanics are neat but very easy to exploit for easy heals lost is the feeling of fighting an opponent technically greater than you and here is the feeling of using outside sources to reduce the monsters chances of doing much to you at all mounting clearly wasnt enough the major issue i have is i dont feel like my own repertoire of moves or skills has increased i feel like my number of scapegoats in tense situations to remove that tension all together has increased rise at least introduces the wirebugs to allow you to act immediately in the heat of the moment some applying more riskreward for skilled players to achieve mastery with wirebug skills i recognise this is quite negative and world is far from the worst game ive played there are aspects i like some of the new monsters are neat enough tobi kadachi is unique with its active motions nergigante deserves its popularity as a genuinely fun and hard monster to fight zorah magdoros is a cool name the story may be lacking but its monster hunter the characters could be more enjoyable but it was certainly not their focus here if you ask me its no wonder why a lot of japan dropped this game for rise world is cumbersome the hub world is a pain to traverse compared to the small compact ones of other games the visuals are cluttered and uninteresting despite the upgrade the newer mechanics serve to dampen the experience rather than enhance it its certainly not all bad but i cant help but look at world as a fundamental soft reboot for the franchise to draw in new unsuspecting meat think about it the mechanics for easiness limited roster the spaced out approach to gameplay the lack of cool and wacky weapon designs past games had world to me was either unfinished or to throw crap at the wall and see what they could get away with you may enjoy world a lot dont let me take that from you more power to you but i only hope you can understand why i find this one lacking to me its just okay at best,False,912,912

76561198039884422,184042953,monster hunter world is one of my favorites in the series if you are on the fence about buying it and playing before wilds i would definitely recommend that you do below are some points of feedback for the developers from a longtime fan with this entry capcom went all in on graphical fidelity and simulated ecology i very much appreciate that the new world feels alive with many animals all living in the same ecosystem and displaying what makes monster hunter special it treats mythical creatures as if they were normal animals and explores their biology and behaviors with the increased graphical fidelity capcom was able to present these ecological details in game rather than through fmv cutscenes like what monster hunter tri had world is easily the most immersive monster hunter game when it comes to being in the field and observing the environment however world makes some changes that i view as negative for the series much of what you do as a hunter has been changed to lessen that feeling of mythical creature hunting simulator that earlier games in the series had much of the crafting system has been removed and made obsolete especially with the inclusion of iceborne i never had to worry about my supplies in world for multiple reasons the first being that there are very few monsters in this game that require you to bring specific items to the hunt to beat them secondly the game hands you hundreds of the items you need by playing a slot machine in seliana so you never need to think about making more of an item in prior games it was always fun admittedly type 2 fun to go out into the world find herbsmushroomsinsects and bring them back to the farm so that they could be reproduced you would then build up this farm over the course of the game so that you could help supply the items you need for hunts this farm still exists but the fact that there is no separate area where you can see those plants growing has always been a little strange it also yields a ton of supplies so you can essentially stop interfacing with this system after only a few hunts rather than throughout the game the supply management part of the game has essentially disappeared which was a large part of selling the hunter simulation i view the inclusion of the clutch claw as largely negative the claw is by no means required until you begin attempting alatreon and fatalis however it will significantly decrease hunt times throughout the whole game combining the claw with the temporal and rocksteady mantles along with the mounting system introduced in the 4th generation games leads to monsters spending a majority of the hunts flailing on the floor i personally think monster hunter games are at their best when the hunter is just barely dodging attacks and counterattacking even while the monster is still in an attack animation all while using items they have prepared to their advantage when monsters spend most of the hunt on the ground it disincentives the player from learning the monsters move set when they can simply kick them while they are down the clutch claw regularly feels like the best option for disabling the monster and has left every other option in the dust this also means that fights were balanced around constant use of the clutch claw monster hunter wilds looks to have at least toned down the clutch claw which i think is a good decision i love the endgame of iceborne safijiva mr kulve taroth alatreon and fatalis are excellent fights alatreon and fatalis feel so tightly tuned that the just barely dodge the monsters attacks and counterattacking even while the monster is still in an attack animation style of play is required overcoming these fights feels like a monumental achievement especially doing them solo i hope that wilds has similar fights that require a ton of preparation and knowledge as well as the ability to perform well for an extended period of time these fights are peak monster hunter endgame the guiding lands was not peak monster hunter endgame the quest system of monster hunter feels great within the context of the world because they are contracts put out by the denizens who live there to solve problems they have hence why you receive reward money for doing them the guiding lands is instead a landmass contrived to allow you to grind monsters endlessly for materials required to upgrade your gear even further it feels like a gameplay contrivance to make people play the game longer rather than something that works in the context of the setting further endless upgrades beyond creating the best weapons does not feel good and i think the augment system should be left behind with world as someone who had several fully augmented sets this review may have sounded mostly negative however i wanted to make the issues i have with this game the bulk of the content this game is pretty close to perfect for me and those things mentioned in the review are the pieces of feedback i want to give

76561198052093579,183616808,i started and uninstalled this game about 3 times before i really got into it for me finding the right weapon combination was the key to enjoying this game they all play very differently and i dont have the time or patience to memorize every monsters attacks and behavior in an effort to just get gud the boss fights are too long at higher levels the timer can run out on monsters you discover in the wild when youre playing solo and you might lose out on a monster you have 34 of the way defeated that stinks but the core gameplay of facing down monsters crafting better gear and then being able to discover new monsters is really rewarding for a while it does get repetitive it does get samey especially when your moveset with your favorite weapon doesnt really expand as you progress the monsters always seem to level up just as much as your weapons and armor does so it never feels like you have a leg up on your opponents so for me the discovery was what made me enjoy my romp through the base game ive taken a break once unlocking iceborne and plan to return in a year or two to discover more monsters and see what this end game loop is all about it can be frustrating it can be unfriendly to newcomers but there is helpful community and there is reward for spending the time to get better at monster hunter world,True,3135,3135

76561198852726067,183599014,best monster hunter game by far lots of content and very fun to play perfect game if youre looking for something to do with friends it is very hype fighting giant monsters with a group of friends lots of weapon diversity to the point where i still dont know what to play with lots of build diversity to back it up through all the dozens of different armor sets and weapons,True,8046,4289
76561198956854473,183588353,this game is bs you take about 20 minutes to kill a monster if you have good gear if you dont then it takes 3040 minutes which is not an acceptable ammount of time honestly with how little the combat diferenciates between monsters it should take about 5 minutes also the combat feels clunky most of the times i die in this masterpiece is because the hitboxes of the monster im fighting glitches and thinks i get hit when im freaking 30 foot away from it also most weapons outside of bow and bowguns get you locked into attacks and just guarantee you getting hit it makes fighting monsters with melle weapons impossible i mainly just use bow and still the ammount of time i get locked into frames is absurd not to mention the times you get free hitted by the monster when he screams at you bla bla bla you have a skill issue study more of the move set of the monsters bla bla you really think im going to spend my precious time studing a freaking videogame nah,False,2519,2492

76561198062942863,183065976,this is possibly one of the best monster hunter games they took everything from the last generation and made everything far better use the environment to defeat monsters a bunch of different tools along with new ones that are better a good list of weapons with new combos and little things like how you can actually move around when using an item to restore statuses or give buffs along with there being more item drops from monsters for buff items instead of just one monster having that one item to make better buff items however the early game weapons look a bit boring which isnt the strongest thing about this game another thing that was tougher with the old games was getting points and money the other games would barely give you any points to use for getting items while here everything is more forgiving along with giving you a better skill to receive more items youll still have to actively get points in the game but its far less tedious compared to previous monster hunter games hint elders recess is good for points besides all of that the game still looks great for something made in 2018 and even back then the entry level for this game wasnt that high looking great on ps4 but not xbox one lol rip pretty much most entry level laptop and desktop gpus can run the game at medium like whats listed in the specs and if you have an entry level nvidia 30 or 40 series card it will look even better i should also mention this game takes some getting used to but the difficulty curve isnt that high compared to other games some advice would be learning a monsters moves and predicting them which is the case for any more difficult game but in the end this is a really fun game with the atmosphere and beauty of the game making it feel more than just a combat focused game btw i played more of this game on ps4 like 300 hours or something so ignore the steam play time,True,5344,4171

76561199197354008,182984527,one of the best games i have played great experience so far and i have barely touched master rank absolutely worth getting for anyone who is interested in monster hunter the game goes into themes of ecological preservation as well as the cycle of life in the different areas of the new world and the themes in general are a lot deeper than in your usual monster hunter on top of that the game is surprisingly beginner friendly as far as monster hunter goes the mechanics are all very conducive while still retaining the tight and precise movement and gameplay that some of the older titles tend to have without trivialising the experience either er besides the defender gear being available so early dont use that a fantastic experience all the way through and while some parts may definitely be a little annoying to some players everything else about the game more that makes up for its flaws,True,8388,7329

76561198127506568,182973346,i slept on this game for a super long time like just this year dec 2024 i got heavily into a build because i was initially put off by the some what childish look and feel of the game and the lack of mobility during combos i tried some different weapons and found the duel swords are high mobility and you can literally shoot through the air like a shuriken cant get too much more bad a than that lol extremely addicting and the story is somewhat repetitive but keeps me interested after you find your weapon that works for you the best the game really opens up not entirely open world but has enough to explore but the game is heavily combat orientated the armor in the game is astounding visually you wont find too many other games with this level of armor design the game can be a grind for certain equipment but is well worth it and it doesnt feel super repetitive fighting the same monsters this game is for sure a good start to a fantastic franchise and i cant wait for wilds coming from someone who has put some 400 hours a piece into different titles over the years this game really was a breath of fresh air compared to the typical run of the mill triple a games,True,2633,2633

76561198381094758,182956505,alright i told myself i wouldnt post a review on this game until i had achieved a thousand hours on it call it a personal milestone of sorts i couldnt even tell you why exactly i set this condition upon myself but regardless i got to this point and i think this game was due for a review to get this out of the way yes i absolutely recommend this game to try to keep my reasoning for it however would be impossible to do in a short manner so while i dont blame you for skipping the rest of this very long review i leave this for anyone that may be weird enough to care to listen to some random guy on the internet rant about what is probably one of their favorite games of all time if not their favorite as of writing this review if youre still reading then here it goes keep in mind im not used to writing reviews like these so i may ramble on way too much the first ever time i hear of monster hunter was back in 2023 a friend of mine was streaming themselves playing it on a discord server they spent most of their time in astera which for those that havent played it yet is basically just the basic hub area and spent some time in the training room to showcase me and some other friends the different weapons of the game i thought the weapons looked cool although nothing that really wowed me the aspect of a sword that transformed into an axe or a giant katana were definitely interesting but it takes a lot more to get my interest in regards to videogames i decided to give this game a go during that year to see if it was worth my time picked up the sword and shield as it was the beginner weapon i hated it im not bad when it comes to 3rd person action games but this game i just couldnt click with at the time the weapons and combat felt clunky things like stun and elemental blights felt like complete and utter bullshit nothing about the world interested me in any way things like finding the monster felt tedious and so i left the game around the first zorah magdaros quest and i never picked it up again until next year going back to the friend i mentioned that friend group is no longer i no longer have contact with anyone but the aforementioned friend that was streaming the game to me it may sound corny and while i certainly dont want to trauma dump to a random reader this devastated me for me these people were my family and i wouldve done anything for them even if they were across different countries the experiences and the love i had for these people is something that i dont think ill ever achieve a similar kind of bond to the one i had with these people one of them in particular the one i was the most fond of hates me and wants nothing to do with me im not going to bore you with the details of what went down but this among other issues that ive been dealing with since my high school years made me spiral down and hit rock bottom in a way i never had before ive been dealing with depression and abandonment issues for the longest time and it wouldnt be an exaggeration to say that event left me quite literally heartbroken this was around back in may of 2024 in a discord server with the one remaining friend i had from that group amongst several other people they were watching on stream one of the new trailers for the new game wilds everyone in that group including myself nowadays is a huge monster hunter nerd and while they were screaming and hyping up everything on screen i simply did not understand what the craze was all about but because i didnt have anything better to do with my time and i was desperate for a distraction from the issues i was dealing with i decided to give world another try a new save file to start from scratch really give it a proper chance this happened in june fast forward to december and well i think my playtime speaks for itself few videogame worlds and universes have captivated me as much as this one has i learned to love everything about the game things that annoyed me such as tracking down the monster back then were now one of my favorite aspects and something i missed in the next installment of the series i loved the monster designs and how unique and varied they were i loved how unique every weapon was each one having their own completely separate playstyle and moveset as well as mechanics i used the sword and shield again and to this day that weapon despite having tried all the other ones is still my main the combat felt so weighty and deliberate i found myself really planning out my attacks based on my position and what the monster was doing and then i finished it and then came the expansion and the expansion oh brother the expansion it feels disingenous to call it an expansion it felt like a completely new game a direct sequel of sorts it heightened everything i loved about the game and more even monsters that i didnt like at first i have grown to appreciate after several hunts this does not apply to rajang however fuck rajang i hope that stupid ass ape never comes back in wilds about the middle point of base game i came to learn about fatalis the very final monster in the expansion and the entire game overall a monster that has multiple appearances across the series revered as the biggest challenge specially in this iteration of it one that many people have simply given up on defeating purely because of how insane the challenge is and i told myself im going to beat it im going to beat it completely on my own while using sword and shield obviously i was getting ahead of myself this i knew but its funny before i started playing i was genuinely contemplating suicide and the only reason i hadnt yet was because i didnt want to hurt anyone by leaving but even then i doubted that anyone would truly care and even if they did they would simply move on yet as i was playing i couldnt even think about that i was too busy to focus on that when i was at work all i could think about was getting home to keep playing this videogame i would lose hours of sleep because i needed just one more hunt i would waste so much of my free time because i needed a stupid fucking legiana gem oh my fucking god bro the idea was that if i pulled that off then maybe i can do whatever i set my mind to if i could do what a lot of people give up on then maybe just maybe i was good enough to pull off anything i wanted and i wasted hours and hours i lost almost an entire week of my life just going at it and there were times where i felt like quitting but i couldnt if i cant even defeat a fictional dragon in a videogame then what can i really do i told myself that this is something ive done a million times attack patterns openings ive done this all before i knew that i could win that i would eventually win and i did it and seeing that camera pan away as the black dragon went limp and its lifeless body lied on top of the cold ground of castle schrade i screamed like i never had before not out of anger but out of happiness of pure ecstacy and pride i still see myself coming back to this game even after i finished rise sunbreaks endgame i still come back every now and then for a hunt or two and all i could say after i defeated fatalis and came back to astera was what a journey man i genuinely dont know where i would be had i not given this game a second chance and im glad i did if youre still reading im thankful that you gave me the time of your day to read some guy ramble about his favorite videogame and im thankful to everyone who worked on the creation on it this game saved my life and i cant wait

76561198996950205,182774085,monster hunter is a game that i feel needs little introduction but perhaps thats less of a testament to how well the game communicates and more of an overt expression to how impossibly addicting the fantasy of monster hunting is it is a game for the people about ambition and the might of the little ones who dare to hone their skills under the spectre of impossible odds every limit can be broken every monster can be hunted and everyone can understand the feeling of overcoming such walls but beyond the idealistic takes on human ambition and its healing nature monster hunter as a franchise is so very honest with itself so unapologetically funny and absurd in all the correct ways to create a world that you desperately want to integrate yourself into and i love that i love that the arrows are the size of umbrellas that the cats cook meals and walk on two legs that the people living in this world still find time to drink and sing inbetween hunts is it perfect of course not some mechanics are poorly implemented and grinding is not something they have succeeded in making enjoyable for the average hunter i cant say that i fully enjoyed every aspect of my progression through the game i so desperately wish they could have implemented layered armour earlier in the game but im still here despite it all every swing of your weapon speaks of who you are make your swings count you cannot take them back,True,22204,21613

76561198143171248,182524302,monster hunter world sorta passed me by in its hay day and im still not sure why that is because im now seriously regretting that i didnt get into it earlier on having come to world after really liking my experience with the open beta test for wilds ive really enjoyed my time with hunting monsters all except for our lord and saviour dodogama and getting to grips with all fourteen weapons despite the fact that im several years behind the tide i will say though that my experiences with the online community that still roams about or just like me are getting into the seriesgame for the first time has been supremely positive the whole multiplayer shtick is incredibly fun and when wilds comes out im sure to do some hunting alongside my friends as a soulslike enjoyer who has always preferred the solo experience im actually the opposite with mh it feels much more rewarding personally to coordinate against monsters solo is still fantastic but i like dabbling in both and feeling positive either or ill list out some quick thoughts of mine the balance of the 14 weapons is great none feel too strong or otherwise unwieldy tbh at some points i would switch weapon every hunt wanting to change up my playstyle rip my materials and i essentially couldnt pick my favourite i like every weapon now in late iceborne ive calmed down a bit and narrowed my selection for the sanity of the grind down to swaxe insect glaive longsword i cant wait to get back to wilds now understanding the identity of the weapons not me not knowing why my charge blade was bouncing off on rei dau or how to charge shield or use phials the content is massive and while a lot of time can be spent rehunting the same monsters the experience is still positive its rewarding prepping and learning the fights to optimise times and be almost hitless something im somewhat used to from souls but nonetheless in a fresh different way theres a significant difficulty curve here and the game at large definitely requires a not small degree of patience iceborne mostly i like this but sometimes it can feel unforgiving which is part of the challenge and the satisfaction of overcoming it but when its down to hitboxes or strange seemingly untelegraphed attacks there is an element of frustration this does little though to ruin the game imo however theres always ways to implement contingency plans whether thats items running away using traps guarding if you dont know whats happening starting turf wars manipulating the environment or just pogoing the glaive which is my goto when theres fuckery about at heart its a game and series more abstractly thats about defeating that which is on a different scale than you both sizewise and powerwise so it makes sense that you cant breeze through it and in order to succeed you need to deeply understand the mechanics and how weapons operate if not reach nighmastery with them overall my time with mhw has been incredibly positive and i really recommend the game although maybe its best to hold out for wilds at this point all i have left to do is defeat the final final monster and ill likely leave this game happily in peace unfortunately while i might want to reach mr 999 i have other things in my life,True,6404,6403

76561198068617514,182082608,compared to other monster hunter games i played this feels just bad it feels extremely slow in the sense that your quest progression gets halted having to do extremely lame investigations that means you walk around collecting random stuff slowly and then having to reload into the area to get even more then finally get to a hunt and then after that more lame slowness investigations wouldnt be so lame if you had a palamute like from rise or some equivalent some of the quests are extremely boring everything surrounding the like 15 minute zorah magdaros fights where you literally just wait around the hub area is dumb everything is separated so you have to walk about 30 seconds or go through a small cinematic to go to an area if you dont want to walk to it this is pretty much after every mission if you want to eat or go to the smithy no reason for the hub area to be so spread out questing with friends is also extremely stupid i cannot quest with my friend because they havent watched a cutscene yet in the mission so they have to load into the quest go and find the monster watch the cutscene then you can start the process of joining that is if you have done the quest already if you are both trying to quest at the same time as in complete quests at the same time you need to load into the quest separately watch the cutscenes then one of you has to back out to go join your friends ongoing quest why tf can i not just join my friends quest and we can watch cutscenes together cant even skip cutscenes btw without a mod rise doesnt have this problem nor any of the other monster hunter games i have played multiplayer with the game looks great the combat feels good the monsters are sick its just everything else surrounding the core of the game is so lame and rips you out of the feeling you get during a sick fight most of these gripes are from a progression standpoint but the point of monster hunter is to progress and get sick gear for fights not walk around and sniff footprints watch lame shit or some other lame shit,False,829,829

76561198051872299,181318723,been playing monster hunter since freedom united on psp this game takes about 5060 hours to beat the base game and i knew what i was doing for a complete newbie id say 7080 hours i passed on the iceborne expansion as a lot of people were not happy with it the base game has what i feel would be less monsters than an old psp game they left out the tigrex in the base game like come on thats a staple monster for monster hunter they also left out lunestra which is pretty much toestras cousin not sure why a lot of the base monsters were not added to base game they most certainly already had models and movesets made for them i felt like a lot of the old monsters were just scrapped and forgotten about which is kind of sad some of the old monster fights were fun and the early monsters in freedom united taught you how to use your weapon this game has about 23 monsters before you fight your first wall anjaith which seems a bit tough on the new players the game doesnt really explain a whole lot unless you go click on everyone and actually interact with folks which i know a lot of new players just want to go hunt and kill things if you are a new player i would recommend you talk to everyone in town and the research ship you will find there are a lot of little things you can do to give you an edge in some fights bow main for life,True,6298,4055

76561198224882660,180638220,frankly one of the few games that stuck with me really well while the story can be a little bit lacking the gameplay makes up for it immensely with how intricate and satisfying it is as well as the depth in its endemic life and interactions between the monsters if youre starting out with the monster hunter franchise this is a good entry to start off with for you to learn on how to play the game and figure out on what weapon you feel comfortable with just dont use the defender gear as it can ruin the experience unless youre wanting to skip to the dlc power to you if its on sale id recommend getting it and the iceborne dlc can be really hard at some monsters just a heads up its really a one of a kind experience in my opinion,True,9868,9862
76561199265905416,180628843,monster hunter is probably my favorite game of all time and i started on the atari it has the perfect blend of difficulty grind crafting and action the grind can cause the occasional rage quit but it will get you back the successes are well rewarded and it actually feels like youre accomplishing something this isnt just your average charge in and kick some monster butt by mashing buttons games of all the monster hunter titles world feels the most like an actual hunt there isnt any collecting little birds like in rise to power you up fir every hunt what a waste of time you actually have to track the monster then the fights monster hunter requires the player to take some time to learn the habits of their quarry once youve gotten the patterns and tells down you can get to work on taking them down also there is such a huge variety of weapon types that all sorts of play styles are supported whether you like the quick blade action of dual blades the slower calculation of a great sword or you prefer to fire at your enemies from afar theres a weapon to suit all preferences finally the graphicsworld definitely has the best graphics on pc at least of all the mh series the armor and weapons you craft actually show on your character and the mechanics arent sloppy hit boxes may cause frustration at times but hey i never said it would be easy all in all if beating the heck out of giant scary monsters cutting them up and making armor out of them sounds like fun to you then you have to try monster hunter,True,5849,4322

76561198429128392,180409904,bought this game on ps4 when it released considering that its the first game to return to the playstation console where it belongs i was willing to overlook any gripes i had with it i quit playing this game when i reached the end of the released content that they had at the time since then the added content could possibly be 3x4x the amount of the original release since i quit playing this game ive heard that they implemented new features mechanics from the newer mh games and its a completely offputting notion it definitely should not be a mandatory mechanic that the game imposes on the player thats like wanting to play mh1 because you dont like the direction the franchise has gone in or you just enjoyed mh1 but capcom decided that theyre going to patch your mh1 game and force you to play the current style of the franchise absolutely inexcusable either way regardless of how bad these new mechanics might make the game unless youre going to hop on the original mh1mhg and join the mholdschool online servers this is a solid pick for immersing yourself in the franchise,True,28,28

76561197995205213,180304503,its monster hunter and the amount of playtime you can get out of it for the price it drops to during sales is insane ive happily spent 100 hours using just one of the 14 weapon types and using a different weapon changes the feel of the game a lot if you havent played a monster hunter game before then this is a great entry point to the series because it has a lot of quality of life improvements compared to older entries its still well populated by people though getting friends into the game is preferable and its so cheap on sale i personally prefer rise to world as i like the extra mobility in that game with riding palamutes and zipping around with wirebugs i also love the mounted combat to make monsters fight and it has my boy magnamalo world also has some things that get in the way of my enjoyment i hate the clutch claw that iceborne introduces its necessary to not make fights take forever but it has horrible aiming and reach and i feel like it breaks the flow of the combat i think some of the maps are awkward to navigate and scoutflies just get in the way more than leading me to the target theres clawshot ammo everywhere so if you try to pick up a material before it despawns youll probably accidentally pick up some stones instead but overall its a load of fun its super satisfying taking down a new monster palicoes are cute as ever making new armour and weapons is rewarding and all of it is better if you can hunt with a pal or three i anticipate wilds will be the best one yet after playing the open beta test but if you cant wait for it or youre not willing to commit to the launch price then by all means dip your toes into world first,True,7178,7178

76561198185044234,179977739,i like monster hunter a lot i started on generations ultimate and i have pretty decent hours in generations ultimate and over 600 in rise mhw has a lot that i like about it and it has a high level of quality ultimately though i wouldnt recommend it im not gonna bother ragging on the whole watch cutscene before multiplayer deal everyone already knows about that and dislikes it gonna start with the good combat is fun i like how the monsters feels in this game i like how the weapons feel in this game i enjoy the combat its monster hunter weapons feel like they pack a punch monsters are challenging and engaging to fight against second this game is obviously pretty though i find this to be somewhat of a doubleedged blade now the bad i find this games overall structure and pacing to be horrendous i feel that in general monster hunter works so well for me because of the more classic monster hunter structure the game gives you large batches of quests at a time with no particular completion order with a certain amount of them being required to complete to progress to the next rank this help give the games a very charming psuedommo kinda feel and allows you to largely play at your own pacewhim this game has completely axed that instead mostly giving you one quest at a time to complete rarely two or three it feels like youre being pretty constantly railroaded into playing the way the writers want you too and that feeling is very antithetical to the design philosophy that i think works for this game additionally theres so many required missions or expeditions that will consist of minutes of slowly walking behind an npc and listening to them talk about whatever is happening in the story a story which isnt nearly wellbaked enough to justify the attention its given the required progressions bits of this game honestly feel like a 21 ratio of walkinglisteningwatching cutscenes to actually hunting monsters it is such a massive slog it also doesnt help that half the maps in the game ancient forest especially are very poorly designed and both difficult and uninteresting to navigate nothing like a monster fleeing in hunt and spending the next 3 minutes traveling annoyingly vertically across an already horizontally massive map circling back to the prettiness of the game i actually really think it can be a negative at times for starters this game is pretty notoriously underoptimized and still has consistent performance issues on decentbutnotfantastic pcs as of late 2024 but aside from performance issues that have gotten less aggressive as time goes on the prettiness of the game leads to some gameplay consequences environments that are packed with excessive amounts of flora combined with gratuitous processing effects lead to very poor visibility in a game where youre punished dramatically for losing focus on the monster youre fighting while this game might sell itself to some on the point that its environment is more immersive though in my opinion the aggressive main character syndrome writing and horrible railroady pacing undermine that immersion in comparison to older titles theres a reason maps in older games occasionally felt more like environmentallythemed collections of boss arenas all in all the game is fun if you havent played any monster hunter before theres a decent chance youll enjoy it but i cant recommend it,False,3178,3085

76561198271018960,179828619,first of all i came from this game after playing rise on switch then pc for several hours and felt kinda meh so guess what i decided to try the older one which is world now you know that my review is not based on the even older mh series here it is the good 1 variety of weapons each with almost completely different mechanics 2 still active online community hopefully still even after wilds release 3 satisfying combat repetitive yes but it feels good when landing hits or when you can finally get used to certain weapons that you like 4 i love character levelling system so i thought i wouldnt like equipment based progression system of world but man i was wrong so many possibilities with builds and afaik many builds are viable instead of only one or two 5 palicoes and i can even dress mine the neutral 1 i expect more of monster varieties i mean this game will even be fine if titled dinodragon hunter because i think 90 of them are modifications of either dinosaurs or dragons i kinda expect fighting spider monster or wolf or cats or ghosts 2 the difficulty is beyond me i need to git gud so many of my assigned quests are helped by strangers so i can farm their materials forge better weapons and armors then i can help others on their assigned quests 3 the ranged weapons are so hard to use with controller i end up using mouse to aim and controller to move which of course didnt work the meh 1 i have omen laptop with ryzen 7 5800h 3070 32gb and sometimes there are random freezes for several seconds and the aa looks kinda horrible i play at 1080p with settings mostly medhigh 90fps capped maybe this game is not well optimized 2 i dont hate the clutch claw and tenderize mechanic but if only theyre made as alternatives to open more possibilities when fighting monsters instead of them being compulsory 3 why do they limit the number of some items in the pouch is it for realism reason 4 i still kinda wish we can at least upgrade our characters based hp and stamina when leveling up rank 5 the multiplayer system is a little bit complicated compared to games like diablo or borderlands for example i will not buy wilds after several years and it got the master edition and heavily discounted so i will keep playing this for a while if anyone wants to play with me kindly add me but pls bring your mid game iceborne weapons im currently using rarity 10 db and lance so you wont one shot the monsters and btw if we use sunrise then this one is iceworld instead of worldborne what kind of name is that cheers,True,6321,4811

76561198353321562,179825548,combat does not feel good story is very lackluster and the game is too grindy for my taste the game has several mechanics that are not intuitive and the tutorials often omit key important details of gameplay systems most bosses are well made but there a glaring one or two that have unredeemable issues for me such as an unblockable and undogeable attack or large desync between sprite and hitbox for a certain boss gave it quite a few hours due to a friend of highly recommending this game you may find it fun but for a casual gamer this was not a good experience,False,8800,8800

76561198880327219,179822852,h3 great game for fans new and old h3 originally got the xbox one version as my first game in the series a few months after release and friends suggested to play together if youre an old fan b highly b suggest you get the base game iceborne bundle but if youre new try out the base game before getting the dlc singleplayer wise for the story its a great experience if youre looking for a smaller focus on an in depth story and just want to u hunt u the u monsters u though for multiplayer up to 4 players in a quest its a lot more complicated in which youll have to watch or most of the time walk tosearch and activate the cutscene before anyone will be able to join you and since that applies to everyone youll either have to leave the quest after watching the cutscene or have your friends do that instead which can get annoying even with that problem since monster health scales with the player count you or your friends shouldnt join too late to ruin a potential first time hunt if youre b not b using guardian armordefender weapons in the base game gameplay wise for new players theres 14 different weapons to choose from arguably fitting any playstyle youd have in mind along with having the option to switch weapons if the one you picked isnt sticking for the grind for new weapons and armor unfortunately it could scale from taking only a few hunts of the same monster to going a whole sitting without getting everything you need if youre struggling with that its best to use the investigation quests you unlock soon into the game which is explained in more detail either in game or a quick internet search to sum everything up couldnt suggest this game more from a pve game lovers standpoint especially if you have free time on your hands i already have mhwilds pre ordered and plan to sink even more hours into it lol,True,63068,62284

76561198002568562,179816405,possibly one of the best pve games ever made its crazy just how much value you can pull out of this one game what i think makes this work is the core combat along with the different weapons monsters are complex enough that you will feel personal growth as you learn all their attacks some weapons are pretty easy to use and some will get better as you get better and understand your opponent this means that you can have a very low effort chill time but you can also challenge yourself to learn something new and more technical youve always got some goal to work towards some new armor you want to make or weapon you want to optimize and once youve done that multiplayer can add a new layer of gameplay as every time you join someone to help you dont know what youre going to get some people dont really need help but other times you have to carry hard and on top of that the game has a strong modding community so you can replay the game in very different ways theres even huge mods that overhaul nearly the entire game and feel almost like a 2nd expansion this is one of those games where you are technically doing the same thing over and over but the thing you are doing is so much fun you want to keep going sheer variety in weapons armors and items can keep you trying out new things for ages before you get bored absolutely stellar value,True,201369,200873

76561199054825749,179454693,as a huge soulslike enjoyer i was looking forward to playing monster hunter world but so far i have experienced nothing but frustration now i am aware that this is not a soulslike but what i was looking for was a similarly addicting gameplay loop and satisfying combat and i have found none of those two things my main issue with monster hunter world is its steep learning curve and the exceptionally poor job it does at explaining to you both how its many convoluted systems work and why each of them is important now a mess around find out approach to teaching game mechanics and systems can work wonders in creating a natural learning experience when said mechanics and systems are simple enough the best example being you guessed it fromsoftwares souls games their core gameplay loop of lockon combat with dodgeblock attack as the fundamentals is simple enough that a few dev messages strewn about the tutorial area or a few popups are enough to teach players the basics and the other systems are naturally woven into the following hours but theyre never thrown at the player at an overwhelming pace monster hunter world takes a similar approach but fails in this regard because it is not a game rooted in a simple but layered gameplay loop it is a chonky systembased game and all it does is throw a bajillion mechanics and systems at you before you can even get accustomed to the core gameplay loop and lets you mess around and maybe figure them out and if you dont figure them out or even forget altogether about things like crafting whose importance is never emphasized by the way well then good luck i guess another big problem i have is the core gameplay loop i am sure there is a lot of enjoyment to be found with it after lucking your way through the myriad of systems and dense menuing and figuring out the chonky combat and weapon movesets but the early game has been nothing but bruteforcing monsters and chasing them around while they retreat only to periodically stumble upon annoying ganks and the monsters being overall extremely erratic plus the lack of iframes on dodges makes the whole combat experience just not click at all with me not to mention the constant pacebreaking chases i have to give and having to constantly repair my weapon its frustrating and annoying more than anything and finally the map design it has been either extremely linear monsterhunting quests or expeditions that consisted of me running around in circles because everything looks the same in the open world wilderness and the map is absolutely awful with no sense of direction or topography while i can see how this game might eventually become super rewarding and addicting for players willing to invest the time my experience as someone new to the series has been overwhelmingly frustrating and i am not willing to pour god knows how many hours of confusion annoyance dense and unintuitive menuing and frustrating chases just to begin to enjoy a game when i can spend that time playing other games that do a better job at respecting my time and good will,False,174,174
76561199071133559,179453419,this game sticks out to me as one of the greatest most fun games i have ever played even after 500 hours of playtime the game is still really challenging but not impossible not only that but the community is super friendly and always willing to help i love that support,True,30330,30007

76561198144909017,179448012,well lets start with the positives a massive and interesting world to explore lovely to look at and amazing variety in both weapons and monsters a game heavily focused on deep combat mechanics and numerous ways to deal with monsters in general a lovely character creator which i personally love in every rpg sick looking armor pieces and if you are willing to put the hours into it the game keeps you busy for an extended amount of time now the negatives i am constantly struggling with the game is good and fun in the first 20 50 hours the game keeps you engaged with its numerous mechanics and possibilities which is massively overwhelming and poorly explained in the game itself especially for newcomers the controls feel absolute alien to anyone used to other games where for example x or rb is your light attack and y rt is your heavy attack the controls in this game feels more kin to a beatemup like dragonball fighterz or soul calibur the greatest flaw in my opinion this game does its best to actively waste your time once you get to the higher ranks or even master rank especially monsters keep running away other great monsters chime in at the most unconvenient times constant roars winds probably even just a gentle breeze of wind keeps your character locked in place and animation basically if an elder dragon ignites its enraged mode you are done playing the game put down the controller make yourself some coffee smoke a cigarette heck start to write a book because you wont be able to play the game for a couple of minutes until everything around you calms down again your character will be busy flying flinging falling and stumbling around as if there was no tomorrow essentially it is probably rightfully called the best multiplayer experience if you have friends that is if you plan to play alone then you are better off playing games that let you play and dont actively waste your time sure i want to enjoy the game i would love to experience the joy of crafting nice looking armor and weapons and i do have above 100 hours at the point of writing this review and i actually would be thrilled to recommend this game to you but if you are like me a latecomer to this game and dont bring a couple of friends initially then you will find yourself ripping your hair and smashing your controller or keyboard most likely a wonderful game for summer holidays vacations etc but for a working person that has around 2 hours of free time to play every day just dont dont put yourself into this neverending spiral of despair and anger,True,15437,6612

76561198149021695,179443026,the monster hunter series is widely regarded as one of the top titles for bossfighting games players can hunt monsters in expansive yet unique and original environments using environmental hazards to enhance their hunting strategies for example the player could trigger a waterfall washing away a firebreathing dragon this design fosters a sense of immersion bumaking players feel like genuine hunters facing formidable creatures in a richly interactive worldub the animation and ai of the dragons are impressive as they exhibit lifelike reptilian behavior they attack and bite like real predators and their movementssleeping hunting and roamingadd to their plausibility making them feel like budynamic alien creatures that players can realistically interact withub however many monsters have bloated health pools often requiring inexperienced players more then 30 minutes to defeat them watching the same repetitive animations over and over can become really meaningless additionally the lategame experience can feel like a grind focused on farming gear from bosses that players have already faced multiple times this leads me to believe that the game suffers from buunnecessarily tedious mechanics that artificially extend playtimeub,True,1937,1937

76561198112323153,179417790,long time fan of the series been playing since monster hunter freedom on the psp so im quite familiar with the series this is my second time with mhw i first got on the ps4 during the pandemic and i wasnt impressed or pulled in by it it was overly enamored with the whole monster hunter biologist vibe and was at a really slow boil compared to other mh titles i decided to buy it on sale andyeahsame problems as before it just isnt clicking for me its not horrible but it feels like the game wants to be ponderous and realistic and sort of more meaningful then it can be when my dinner is served to me by dancing cats of course the entire series has always taken itself too seriouslybut that always felt like part of the joke mhw felt like it was designed by someone who didnt realize it was supposed to be campy so everything is more considered over loaded and you cant do anything at all without getting a minitutorial dumped in your face that vomits words at you while explaining nothing i cant just hunt dinosaur dragons because its interesting and theyre dangerous now i need to know why ehhhhh i went to join the online play as soon as i couldand there wasnt any online play i could do the game took the time to tell me i could access a mode where i couldnt actually do much of anything whats the point in that meanwhile i go over the monster hunter rise still campy but its self aware im a ninja monster hunter why am i hunting monsters because there are big monsters out there thats why ill go out with my ninja dog ninja cat ninja bird and ninja bugs and do ninja stuff at monsters until they die and another monster shows up the tutorials are just as bloated and stupidbut its a lot easier to figure things out intuitively even if you cant you can actually get into the game play when the game tells you the mode is open it doesnt bait and switch you by saying that a game mode is open but then offering you a game mode where nothing is unlocked to play im not going to return it because i love this franchisebut mhws user friendliness is abysmaland yes i absolutely know how weird that sounds given all the quality of life improvements this title represented i would have given up the lack of quality of life improvements for the familiarity of a game that let me get in over my head if i was capable of coming out alive i dont often like challenging games so this feels weird to saybut i like it when mh just gets out of my way and lets me sink or swim on my own terms ive seen reviews suggest that rise is an inferior titlebut i dont agree world feels more polished to be sure but it doesnt seem to be lined up with the things i love best about the series overall i recommend the gamebut i dont think its the exmplar of the series that others make it out to be,True,87,87

76561198125738220,179415490,debated buying this game for years got it for 10 dollars during the sale i really think this game lacks a lot of fluidity for multiplayer but is really solid if you are going it alone that being said this game really needs some shoe shine to fix and polish its more rough features such as character customization is locked behind a dlc you can use once something thats big for me is character customization and this game has high chances to really fuck up your face another issue is mogging or transmogging which put simply is changing the appearance of your armor and weapons now this game does it almost right but still lacks the ability to make your character look the part of a badass who hunts down large creatures you kinda look goofy through the first 100 hours im guesssing but overall those are small gripes the combat is fresh feeling but sometimes a little janky depending on weapons types easily enough something like this would be less important to someone who gets tired of pressing the same 3 buttons in an order i did enjoy this game with lots of interest and i do hope that this franchise marks itself as a more online experience for now though i think its maybe sells 2030 dollars release and 10 dollars after a couple years which is why i never payed full price to begin with i did enjoy my short playthrough and may play more in the future however with wilds coming out and world not being touched i think its safe to say i wont be milking anymore content from this game do try on sale but dont break the bank for a game that really isnt changing too much over its sequals,True,1605,1605

76561198079732920,179383575,i highly recommend this game this game without trying to sound like a pretentious arts major is in fact a work of art through and through not only through the high resolution pack that comes with the game but through the presentation and dynamics of full biomes with local fauna and creatures of every size functioning in their own unique ecosystem stepping into this world is truly breathtaking i have played through the first arc of this game being the zorah magdaros arc once through ps5 and once through pc i used the defender armor on the ps5 and various monster armor throughout the pc playthrough and i must say playing the game with vs without the defender armor are two completely separate games in good conscience i cannot recommend using the defender armor nor the weapons unless youre starting a new save as a veteran and you want to blitz through the game to get to the iceborne dlc if youre playing the game for the first time the best thing that i can recommend for you to do is to play the game as slowly as you can you will eventually be able to hunt the cooler and bigger monsters but you can take your time getting there this is definitely one those games that its just as much about the journey as it is about the gameplay and the various mechanics of the game the best parts about this game are discovering a new monster to only get your ass handed to you and have to go back and hunt a different monster for a better stat line to hunt the new monster thats beating you down using the defender gear completely removes those types of interactions from the game for a chunk of the game well into the iceborne dlc itself monster hunter world excels when youre constantly engaging with the mechanics of crafting gear and weapons to build against various monsters tldr gorgeous looking game that runs well and if it doesnt for you there a free mods that can be easily installed and acquired to help improve performance on any and all pcs if youre a veteran looking to get that itch scratched before wilds releases now is the perfect time to get back into the swing of things if youre someone who tried out the beta for wilds and are wanting to get more of that fill than worlds is the game for you if youre a returning player i recommend the defender gear just until you finish the first arc and then continue from there if youre trying this game for the first time i could not recommend starting the game using the standard weapons and gear and then building your way up anymore the true monster hunter experience is the journey from starting at nothing to becoming the best that there ever has been pick this game up if you can,True,3541,3082

76561198112596020,179218442,it is my time to enter monster hunter for the first time and here is where my experience began monster hunter world is a fun and large game that in my opinion suffers from terrible ui terrible tutorials convoluted maps convoluted hub world extremely slow movement and climbing climbing climbing as well as very annoying repetitive systems of tracking monsters down that feels less like hunting the monster and more running around like a chicken with your head cut off searching for the farts of the monster so you can sniff it and then follow its trail to a pile of shit and then follow its trail to some mucus which then brings you to the monster considering if you know the knowledge of the monsters location which is always in the same place you can simply go to it to cut to the chase though i stopped playing this game 12 hours in and went over to rise which i significantly loved more which makes it hard for me to come back to this game but i definitely eventually will rise fixed every annoyance and peeve i had about this game faster movement faster climbing no convoluted hub world thats easy to get around and do what you want to do no convoluted maps and generally expanded upon systems most importantly no annoyingly repetitive tracking system that felt like such a chore to go through ive seen many agree that no tracking is great in rise as they also found it time consuming and not fun generally annoying ive seen others argue its kinda what makes monster hunter the game i disagree though tracking monsters or animals does make a major role in the concept of hunting it needs to be done way better so i hope if it returns they create a much more fun and interesting system in wilds which i know nothing about otherwise its for the best that its completely absent in rise lets get to the fight already my biggest issue is how this game might be recommended as a start to players new to the series like myself many have but i find its introduction to be overwhelming and terribly explained often also throwing walls of text at you it is done far better in rise and after just about a few hours of introduction in rise i felt like i could come back to this game and understand things far more which i allso think speaks volumes to how much better rise would be as someones first game in the series 8610 overall world is a solid experience but i await my time for when i will finally get to the actual fight among other annoyances that gave me a headache,True,728,728

76561198274117850,179175103,at first this game had its moments and i had a fun time with it however after a while it became extremely boring repetitive and tedious while the thrill of tracking and taking down new monsters is undeniably exciting at first the repetitive nature of the gameplay quickly drains that excitement each monster is designed with incredible detail from their unique appearances to their attack patterns and behavior however once the initial awe wears off the grindheavy gameplay starts to feel monotonous and unfulfilling the core gameplay loop revolves around hunting monsters crafting gear and upgrading your equipment for fans of grindheavy experiences this might sound appealing but for anyone else it quickly becomes tedious missions blur together as they all boil down to the same objective hunt another monster playing solo amplifies the monotony as battles with monsters often drag on due to their massive health pools while some encounters provide a decent challenge most feel more like endurance tests rather than exercises in actual skill combat is functional but flawed it attempts to blend hackandslash mechanics with soulslike elements requiring precise timing for attacks and dodges however the lack of a lockon system feels clunky and takes some getting used to the variety of weapons is a highlight offering unique playstyles but even that novelty doesnt sustain the gameplay for long monster design is undeniably the games strongest aspect each creature feels alive with fluid animations realistic behavior and a sense of presence thats hard to match seeing monsters interact with the environment or battle each other is genuinely impressive the visuals however are inconsistent while the environments are vibrant and full of life textures lack detail lighting and shadows often feel off and the antialiasing blurs the image the game also struggles with distant objects and animations dropping in framerate further breaking immersion lipsyncing during cutscenes is atrocious making the already weak story even harder to care about speaking of the storyits barely worth mentioning its a forgettable cringeworthy excuse to set up monster hunts with dialogue that often borders on nonsensical the cutscenes are equally unremarkablelong dull and completely skippable some missions are outright poorly designed gathering items like mushrooms honey or eggs or killing small creatures such as insects or wildlife is mindnumbingly boring and unrewarding even the main missions arent spared the zorah magdaros encounter for example is tedious uninspired and ultimately feels like filler its a glaring example of how the game struggles to provide engaging content beyond its core hunting mechanics after like 50 hours with the game the flaws became impossible to ignore the grind which was initially addictive became exhausting every quest is essentially the same hunt the same monsters gather loot craft gear and repeat by the time i had my ideal weapon and armor i realized there was no compelling reason to continue the game offers nothing to alleviate the repetitive cycle and once the novelty of hunting monsters fades so does the games appeal ultimately monster hunter world thrives on its grind and the thrill of the hunt if that doesnt appeal to you this game will quickly lose its charm while the monster designs and environments are impressive the repetitive gameplay lackluster story and uninspired mission design overshadow its strengths for me it became uninteresting and ultimately super boring,False,34176,12909

76561198005364853,179078112,they ought to call this game b monster hunter running b since most of the time youre running around chasing monsters than actually fighting them the game was pretty fun early on but now when taking 7 star quests for some reason all the flying monsters rathalos rathian legiana etc wont stay in a fight for more than a few 3 5 minutes before flying to the other side of the map forcing you to waste even more time and do more laps around the same areas to catch up to them and when they do fly away you have even less time to reach them before the fly away again forcing you to recommence the search process so 34 of the hunts will include chasing the monster down and 14 involves actually fighting that shit gets repetitive and stale real fast what makes it worse is the moment they do fly away youre now at the mercy of the games b a b y s m a l b guiding system half the time the firefly will lead you the wrong way to some out of the way path just to pick at a plant on the side of a wall other than that the game is real good and id still recommend buying itwhen its on sale,False,1543,1543

76561198254447774,178937250,other large monsters invading and deciding to team up against you seem to happen relatively often meaning that you are forced to disengage unless you have dungpods on the ready biggest offender of this may be the when the mist taketh you quest in iceborne where you are more often than not fighting a shrieking legiana and a normal legiana shrieking legiana alone is very annoying due to iceblight and the infinite amount of shrieks he does he may as well be an ice khezu updateprefatalisat velkhana with more hours into this game200hrs at the time of this update it feels like ive gotten more of a grasp into this game while my original recommendation still stands i do feel that some aspects of this games world that is commonly praised also have a downside to them mostly to do with the locales within the game the ancient forest is a pretty big locale that i think some may find annoying because of how twisted the paths in it can be but my main gripe with this map has to do with the sheer amount of foliage in this gameand ledges which ill get to later while it does help to build upon the grandeur of the map helping it live up to its namesake when it comes to exploration i think this may be the single biggest downside of the map if you ever have to actually fight something here more often than not youre likely to find that your camera has been obstructed by the foliage when dancing around with monsters in battle which may or may not get you carted depending on your luck another point regarding the local ecology which encompasses all locales are the small monsters that reside in these regions more often than not they end up being a hindrance to the flow of the battleand in some cases with monsters like girros will straight up get you killed smaller monsters may obstruct your view on occasionflying monsters in the elders recess is a prime example whilst large monsters could straight up push you away or block your attack for a game often praised for its ability to make the ingame world feel real it does feel like they missed the point with making these monsters stick around while you are busy fighting a monster that could kill them with a stray attack lastly ledges i cannot put it into words how much of a doubleedged sword ledges are offensively they are a great addition for some weaponsfrom what ive heard i play bow but melees seem to benefit from them while on other ocacsions they will quite literally get you killed god forbid you accidentally dodge and sprint onto a ledge causing you to jump offclimb up getting you killed at a moment that shouldve been a few seconds of reprise due to a well timed dodge in hindsight this game deserves the flowers it has been showered with the praises sung for it can easily be witnessed when you play the gameno matter if you have just started or are a seasoned veteran but i do feel that some aspects do get stale over time having to obtain the tracks for monsters to identify their location does highlight the hunt pat of monster hunter but after a while you will recognize that most monsters have a few areas in which they will showup legiana in the coral highlands feels like they are guaranteed to spawn in the same 3 areas diablos more often than not is in the sandy areas of the wildspire waste whereas some monsters like rathalos may force your hand as they are more likely to roam around a large portion of the map in conclusion monster hunter is a great game the grounded and slowerpaced combat fits well with the attempts to make the world feel realisticmuch to my dismay in some heated moments it definitely has a great gameplay loop when it comes to hunting monsterswell msot monsters to grind even if i feel like there are some questionable choices for the endgame bosses the game still feels rewarding when you manage to nail down aspects of certain fights such as learning and punishing movesets although if you prefer fasterpaced arcadey combat mh rise definitely feels like a better option despite its watered down graphicsthanks to the switch being a potato i personally think the endgame bossesrisen elders and such are a very fun experience once you get used to them although base rise may feel like a slog to get through sunbreak is definitely a toptier experienceibushi narwa and amatsu are definitely one of the elder dragons of all time,True,13788,11981

76561198007605028,178933560,pros combat is very accurate ranges and collissions are realistic the game is funnier indeed if played in coop cons the game is not an action game as you expect but some sort of memory test to check if you remind monsters moveset let me explainwhen a dragon charges you cannot dodge and you will be more lilely trampledthe key for victory are not you reflex but is reminding that when the dragon begins to scratch is gonna chargewhen it scratches its head is when you have to click dodge with success this is most of time what happens ingame often monsters have one shot combo like attackstunsecond attack while stunned than you die with no chances it is frustrating and often quite clueless,True,12429,9360

76561198344874942,178489689,review aimed for those who have never played mh games before since vets should already know what this game is like mhworld is a great option for those who have never actually played any monhun games before to start out from and if you found yourself interested you can even get the iceborne expansionin fact you should because it pretty much triples the content as per usual wait for discount since full price is pricey af the early game can be a slog and getting used to weapons will take a while controller is highly recommended though still doable with kbm the gameplay loop is basically just find monsterhunt monsterrepeat it can get repetitive and mundane at times having to chase stuff around the map for like 20 minutes so its definitely not for everyone but is it fun hell fucking yeah it is even better if you can find 3 other friends to goof around with you go in find big monster and you whack the big monsters with big weapons while everything else is just there to make you whack the monster harder the end simple but sometimes simple stuff are also the most fun stuff tldr its a fun action game where you go in and well hunt monsters dont worry too much about story its just there as an excuse to make the cool monsters appear if youre checking this game out because of mhwilds do definitely give this a shot,True,15393,14862

76561198814546883,177945764,h1 spending time with your cat and i guess hunting monsters h1 is my first game in the franchise i always heard that it was a franchise known for grind like crazy without a job but that this game was the exception and thats true out of the approximately 50 hours it took me to finish the game i only grinded one monster because not all my weapons were effective against the fire kitty taking this context into account lets begin with the notsoserious review that arrives about 6 years late graphics and aesthetics visuals for a game from 2018 it looks pretty good there are contemporary games with better visuals but monster hunter world holds its own and in my opinion it has aged well you wont see the pores on the handler but it looks good art style the art style is very immersive and distinctive giving the game its own unique personality gameplay hunting mechanics you feel like a true hunter stalking and utilizing your environment to track and slay any monster that dares to look at you the wrong way however you always feel the threat posed by many species of monsters especially towards the end like the bomber plane with legs that ruined more than one of my hunts multiplayer honestly i never used it because i prefer enjoying these types of games solo but i had to mention it because it exists although i have no idea how active it still is i only shot off a multiplayer flare once in the entire game to get an achievement but no one showed up story narrative a story that could be described as linear but its quite engaging i appreciate how the new world the continent itself is part of the narrative nothing from the other world get it hehe but it gets the job done open world you can go on expeditions without specific objectives just to explore and hunt anything that moves without time limits its quite fun and immersive just to enjoy the environment and the wild battles that turn a peaceful stroll into a race for your life if you werent wellequipped that pickle gave me a scare the first time it attacked progression and gameplay loop progression system here comes the finely tuned gameplay loop of this gaming masterpiece pay attention kill monsters to getimprove weapons and armor to kill stronger monsters and obtain even stronger weapons and armor to hunt even stronger monsters i think you get the idea its incredible how addictive and wellcrafted this system is rewards if it wasnt clear from the previous point that im a fake human well there are many more rewards to talk about like jewels but its better for everyone to discover those on their own challenges and difficulties difficulty level a progressively challenging curve thats quite accessible to anyone there are certain monsters that present a sudden spike in difficulty still traumatized by nergigante but overall the hunts are challenging yet fair making you feel that if you fail its because you didnt prepare well enough or because your cat has better reflexes than you or maybe thats just me pdf tutorials i didnt know what to call this point but i mention it just to say that the tutorials seem designed to disrupt the gameplay rhythm as some overload you with information even for the most basic things it can be a bit annoying at first but its a minor inconvenience to survive to enjoy this amazing game sound and music soundtrack very memorable and immersive just listen to the theme of my nightmare generator nergigante sound effects equally good as the previous point although not mandatory its recommended to play with headphones conclusion one of the best games ive played this year its absolutely worth it ps anyone who doesnt take their cat on adventures deserves jail time the cat is the most important monster hunting is secondary rating 910 you cant pet your cat,True,2902,2902

76561197970857145,177543017,h1boring decent bad cooph1 its not bad but i went into the game completely blind thinking this would be a good coop game turns out its an ok game but a bad coop game h2cooph2 this was the main reason i bought this but it turns out this is not a coop game its an occasional coop with strict limitations game what i mean is this byou can not coop this game from start to finish with a friend playing along with you periodb olist the game has this darksouls like invasion mechanic where you can summonrequest help from random players in some missions at certain points however instead asking randoms for help bthisb is the moment you can ask directly your coop friend to help and most often bonlyb at these points apart from the above mentioned coop feature you can sometimes in rare occasions start a mission with your friend but even then its usually bonlyb if they have already beaten the said mission previously yes youve read that right in a lot o missions if your friend has not played the mission as you would if you are u know bplaying fing coopb they can not join in period on one positive note the world loot is not shared but individualized so you dont need to fight over it also as far as i can tell there is no friendly fire olist h2combath2 this is going to be more of a matter of taste but i really dont like it and the reason is tank controls now i dont mean the way that the character moves but the way they attack you character does not attack in the direction you are looking but in the direction the character model is facing when you start attacking and it will not change direction with two exceptions when using a sword shield aka the second most boring weapon in the game or a ranged weapon aka the most boring weapon in the game with any other weapon you are stuck attacking into the direction you were facing and the lockon system just hinders you because it jumps around like a flee on meth and just makes an annoying combat actually impossible because it never targets the enemy closest to you this game also comes with a combo system which means that unless you are doing the combos aka multiple specific attacks inarow uninterrupted not only are you doing but a fraction of the damage you shouldneed to be doing you also can not interrupt your own attacks to dodge or block once you start swinging you are locked in which means you cant react to enemies its about to charge better dodge oh no no you need to memorize their combat ai to know exactly how much time and what behavior set follows which or you are going to get just thrown around the game is not particularly hard per se but its frustrating and annoying i did not die once playing the game allthough i was more then once nearly oneshot also not cool but the combat drove me absolutely mad not because of any challenge but because i did not feel like i was fighting the dinos but my own character and the controls on a positive note the game has a lot of weapons and i tried them all and they are all very flashy and over the top and the animations are very pretty and smooth h2monstersh2 i dont know what i was expecting going into a game called the monster hunter but i was disappointed what i mean is that when i hear the word monster i dont think dinosaurs and i especially dont think just dinosaurs occasional giant bat beetle and a goatdeer this game should have been called jurassic hunter or strike dino crisis strike or swordrex or barney may cry i honestly thought the game would feature something like goblins minotaurs demons undead you know bmonstersb this game just makes me feel bad slaughtering all the dinos going about their business its like playing morrowind an only killing scribs and netches and the worst part you cant even tame them no raptor mounts shame on you capcom h2storyh2 i realize people dont play these kinds of games for their story or immersion and i can see why but the thing is i do i am the kind of person who plays eg path of exile and diablo 2 because i enjoy the story and the world theyve built and uh its well honestly i cant tell you what exactly it is the story of the game is that you are a part of the 5th fleet of researchers who want to capture a kaiju monster made out of lava rocks because ummm science now the reason you are the 5th fleet is because the other fleetsgenerations who tried it before you decided that researching was for nerds and they turned into bunch of edgy hermits druggies and im too kool 4 skool types and wanted to just hunt and eat dinos i guess so the mo of the 5th fleet is pretty much this time we bwontb get bored out of out minds and go insane but actually do what we were supposed to do and by the gods that creature that keeps following you through out the game and just keeps annoying you and keeps getting into trouble why why why why did you capcom think it was cute and no im not talking about the sentient cat slave thats fine im talking about is the infamous creature known as the handler because she apparently knows just how down right criminally annoying she is that she wont ever tell you her name so you cant sue her in the dinocourt or commit her to a mental institution and i swear this is not made up but on top of it all she decided to dress up like a goddamn furry cat for like most the time i played the game and only stopped once id decided i that ive had enough of this game so anyway the game story is to research the dinos and you spend the whole game just slaughtering them for their shiny bits to make shinier weapons to slaughter even more of them i am no zoologist but i pretty confident that thats now how it works at least in pokemon games you mostly just capture them and interbreed them and you know what maybe slaughtering pokemons would be a better idea hey whats this palword thing h2systemsh2 ill be honest this game is a bit too much information dump for anyone new to the game and it really kind of burned me out its a lot like id imagine anyone whos never played path of exile would feel playing it for the first time today also the crafting system seems both okay but also i need 5 butt feathers from a dino that takes 1015 minutes to kill each time and its not even a guaranteed drop kind of deal grinding materials is fine when the combat is fun but like i said in my combat section its really not its functional with its very own special rules its challenging the same way as trying to cancel your cable is challenging but fun it is not h2character creationh2 this is a bit weird capcom has shown with ddda that they can make a character creator with normal people but here what happened its not horrible but they are all well the best way to describe them is tall dwarfs their legs are too short heads are too big and i cant for the life of me produce an actual pretty female character i have to cover her face with really colorful make up because these ladies really hit their face on every branch of the ugly tree the way down and then someone stole their breasts and buttocks on top of it i mean its not as bad as in the recent redacted or redacted and lets not forget that horrible tv show super redacted but i wonder if the real reason they doing the dino research is to find the lost xchromosome h2tldrh2 it has somewhat stylish but annoyingly clunky combat on top of nonexistent coop mixed with story of stupid in a world of stupid but objectively its not a bad game just a bit too annoying for my taste,False,885,885

76561198840132958,177250400,the game goes to elaborate lengths to really capture this feeling of being a hunter so insanely well by how elaborate and interactive the fights are by identifying preparing tracking and hunting down the monsters with each one requiring different equipment and strategies as well as the fights all taking place in a very immersive and interactive ecosystem where youll be using everything available to you during the fights each fight is an extremely engaging 30 minute long adrenaline rush where every moment feels like youre just barely hanging on from the monsters attacks as well as making you feel completely unmatched as the monster throws you around like a toy effortlessly or watching monsters clash against each other in turf wars and then having a gradual shift in tides where you take control of the fight as you break off parts of the monster making it slowly become weaker the combat and controls for this game not everyone will like and takes some getting used to it the controls are a lot more slow and deliberate that feels stiff and clunky but in a really good way and once it all clicks with you youll be hooked the combat is extremely enjoyable and addictive once you start learning the rhythm and movesets of each fight its extremely well done with intricate mechanics and complexities that is easy to get in to but also has a really high skill gap with incredible depth with each weapon feeling like youre playing an entirely different game with all of that being said now for my criticisms which i have a lot firstly the game loves to waste your time on purpose from the layout of the astera hub unskippable cutscenes terrible and slow menus and uis tracking monsters having to go through 5 diologues to talk to npcs etc in a game where you do the same thing a million times it needs to be streamlined as much as possible grinding for equipment and jewels just comes down to pure rng where youll be fighting the same monster a dozen times for hours in hopes of getting a specific drop its not fun or interesting in any way in my opinion and just adds artificial time length to the game like everything else in the game that is made to waste your time theres a million different subsystems and garbage mechanics and items that all add nothing of value to the game for no reason all of which poorly executed or unneeded that all add up to make the game extremely tedious and ruin the experience in my opinion some examples for me being mantles clutch claw a million different consumables and throwables hotcold potions etc the storyline is a joke which wouldnt be a big deal since its not the focus of the game and not what people play for but it often gets in the way of the gameplay for me with boring story missions you have to do now for the monster fights there is a difference besides a skill issue in monster difficulty that is fun to fight and annoying to fight majority of the monsters in this game fall under the annoying difficulty every single monster needs to have annoying aoe lingering status effect attacks or one shot you because you didnt iframe a roar terrible hitboxes and then of course the clutch claw and tenderizing mechanic that youre pretty much forced to use to keep up with damage on later monsters there is also a time limit on quests which i think is really cheap artificial difficulty there are better solutions turf wars while they are cool the first few times just ruin the flows of fights i think and is executed poorly and doesnt make for good gameplay and dung pods arent a solution either because it just means another niche item i have to carry around and would either just not work or have the monster come back like 2 minutes later same with tracking monsters which i think doesnt make for interesting exploration picking up tracks on the ground a million times aimlessly in a giant maze until a trail appears that takes you right to the monster except it decides to not work half of the time i dont care too much for an elaborate map when im spending 90 of the time fighting the monster in my opinion but others may disagree also with each fight sometimes being upwards of 3050 minutes long how is there not a pause feature the game just has a different design philosophy than what im used to that not everyone will like but its the most addicted ive been to a game in a long time im now 150 hours deep and still have some more post game content to do the guiding lands grind is really enjoyable for me definitely worth the price especially with iceborne theres just so many weird design choices in this game that could easily be improved upon and hope they do in future titles 8510,True,11119,11119

76561199166745016,176962593,im in love with this franchise now singlehandedly because of this game its pretty addicting and its fun as balls i really recommend it just goofying around and going on some basic expeditions is so much fun dont even get me started on the mainline quests although in my opinion some of the special moves could a little more fast paced to use depending on the weapon you choose and the extra gadgets you obtain could be used in more significant ways or with a single button press instead of cycling through a menu every single time theyre still pretty fun mechanics to utilize and still are really well designed personally i always prefer beating the living hell out of the monsters but the capture options are also great fun when youre not trying to capture a giant firebreathing dragon that is and even with all that playing the game with a friend makes it 10x times more fun as its also a really good coop game suprisingly all in all its a super well made game thats really really fun and addicting currently in my top 10 games ever with only 18h played for now and planning to play much more for anyone a fan of fighting giant monsters with either a big sword a big hammer or both its a must have game really excited to try out mh wilds when that comes out ill be looking forward to it,True,3031,1122

76561198853103939,176960099,i come from playing rise before this one i got this game to play with friends and because i was constantly told that world is far superior than rise by several people i have encountered many issues with this game its progression felt much slower and much less rewarding in every aspect i like the expeditions in this game way more but they serve no real purpose up until high rank where they give them the only purpose of discovering high rank variants of monsters over there to unlock the quest to beat them this caused me issues because after reaching high rank i immediately went and did a quest for the chef cat in high rank rotten valley where i saw a high rank odogaron it took me over 20 odogaron from that quest or the expeditions to make 4 out of 5 pieces of its armor because the expedition rewards are genuinely bad despite what i said earlier getting the actual quest to fight a monster after discovering it while you go through high rank expeditions quests are still locked by your hunter rank this meant that my only source of odogaron materials were expeditions and that one quest from the chef for a while since i was forced to progress through the story if i wanted to get the odogaron hunt quest or if i wanted to get investigations for it instead of radobaan or great girros investigations nonstop i even managed to get gems from the thing before ever getting one of the five bones i needed for the last piece of gear as for weapons elemental damage is really bad with my weapon class of choice so i was basically locked to play with the ore weapon or any other physical damage one although even if elemental damage was any good 90 of the weapon designs are the basic ore or bone weapons with skin from the monsters glued to them and it is like this across all the weapon classes for the entire duration of the game when it comes to the ancient dragons they arent even fun to fight because they are barely capable of fighting back or they have the most annoying gimmick ever that does nothing but slow down the fight by a lot however i decided to rush through the base game to start the expansion and so far none of my issues have been addressed or improved by a lot if anything new issues have appeared the clutch claw that was more of an optional thing through the base game has become a must in this dlc where it was added making the gameplay loop more boring and repetitive the general idea is that you have to soften body parts in order to do actual damage to the monsters as well as using other mechanics related to the claw like an attack to make monsters run into a wall and crash against it so basically the dlc has done nothing but slow down the game by a lot so far it feels like i gotta wait a while for my turn to soften body parts as the monster just relentlessly swings at me and i just move around it to avoid getting hit then i have to pray to god when i get on a body part with the claw that it doesnt do an attack to get me off of it and start all over if you reeeally dont mind any of what ive just said you might enjoy this game but i honestly didnt,False,11283,3639

76561199093759048,176918287,btoday is a special day for me its my birthday and as i reflect on past memories theres one story that stands out which ties into why im reviewing the game monster hunter world on steamb after an unforgettable educational trip to japan where i met my wife life took a different turn about a year or two later during winter my friend and i decided to organize a cabin getaway with two girls from our class including my girlfriend we were all from the same class except for one girl who was from another but we all had gone on that educational trip to japan together this wasnt just any trip it took some effort to plan since accommodations back then were a bit pricier than they are now but with determination we made it happen the cabin we stayed at had a stunning fireplace that created a cozy atmosphere perfect for those cold winter nights it also featured hot baths where we could unwind and enjoy our time together memories from that trip are a bit hazy after all this time but the excitement of the upcoming fireworks show was fresh in our minds my friend and i knew there were two spots to watch the fireworks one from the resort and another higher up on the mountain we both agreed that the view from the mountain was far better for my secret plans of losing my virginity to my girlfriend who was completely unaware of my intentions we knew that one girl and my girlfriend wanted to stay at the resort while my friend and i along with the third girl were eager to head to the mountain to resolve this disagreement my friend had a genius idea we decided to play a poker game he decided to side with the third girl and my girlfriend to convince them to accept the poker game by aligning himself with them he made it seem like he was genuinely interested in staying at the resort making the poker game appear like a fun way to resolve the situation but just in case we lost we had discussed a plan b the night before while relaxing in the hot tubs my friend and i talked about what we would do if the poker game didnt work out he suggested that if we lost he would head to the hot baths for a while and create a distraction after the poker game which we unfortunately lost my friend put plan b into action he went to the hot baths and once he was there i took a moment to talk with my girlfriend about my plans for the evening she was on board excited about the idea of spending some intimate time together as planned my friend stayed in the hot baths longer than expected letting the girls wonder how long he was going to remain there to heighten the drama he pretended to faint making it look like the heat had gotten to him suddenly all eyes turned to him and a crowd began to gather the entire resort was buzzing with concern creating a crazy moment for my friend to play his role he expertly kept the girls entertained and distracted allowing me to lead my girlfriend out for a private moment with everyone focused on my friends fainting we finally got the time we had been hoping for after a little while my friend woke up from his faint continuing the act to ensure that no one suspected what was happening the chaos provided the perfect cover for us it was all about teamwork much like in monster hunter world where you need to cooperate with your buddies sometimes to hunt a bigger monster that night my buddy and i had a goal to hunt my devirginization and the teamwork we displayed was truly awesome now at 82 years old just like my wife i look back on that winter cabin getaway as one of the most unforgettable experiences of my life,True,741,741

76561198043853041,176889959,for all of its faults this remains my favourite game of all time i have put hundreds of hours over several consoles into this game alone the feeling of enjoyment i get from it now is pretty much the same as the enjoyment i got from it at the start if i get bored i just try a new weapon some elements of this game do wear thin over time but its the vibe of the mh series as a whole that really manages to captivate me at its core you get a fun game where you get to hunt cool monsters which get mechanically harder as you progress and make equipment out of the parts that you gain from hunting those monsters thats the pitch under the surface you get a rich world an ecosystem with established lore that doesnt feel awkward to come into as a newcomer the combat system is satisfying and rewarding and if you play this game to the end you will have a favourite fight the level of detail in this game at times is insane the animations that play as the cats cook for you the routines those cats have outside of those animations i know the meowscular chefor his seliana mentor are going to cook the same feast i see every time i eat at the canteen i am still going to watch the animation play out because they absolutely didnt need to do that but they did and as a result it adds to the charm that this game has the cast of diverse and whimsical characters that you become attached to love and hate are a testament to the feeling that this game has in spades the story of monster hunter is never the main appeal as much as it is a vehicle to progress you to the next big bad but even knowing this they manage to create memorable interactions between you and these distinct personalities even the base camps are designed to look grandiose and are somewhere between studio ghibli and the flintstones the feeling of seeing astera for the first time will always stick with me to me it feels cozy and familiar and i think if you can get past the initial bloat and overwhelming amount of information thrown your way i think it will feel that way to you too this is the one that has made me a lifelong fan even going back and playing older entries just to have more i really truly hope that you give this game a shot,True,15584,10950

76561198091990854,176527464,to the untrained observer monster hunter world may look like a typical action rpg with a more prehistoric aesthetic but dont let that fool you the monster hunter series is truly unique and it might take some personal adjustment if youre more accustomed to games like elden ring or devil may cry if youre thinking about getting into this series there are a couple of things you should know first and foremost progression is determined by equipment you do not level up your character in any fashion beyond the upgradeable armor and weapons that your character uses second playstyle is determined by the weapons that you wield there are 14 weapon types in the game and you can freely alternate between them without having to worry about stat thresholds while you should expect to change equipment regularly you will never have to grind or respec your character to equip a weapon third success in combat requires preparation an precision a lot of new players tend to complain about how slow and clunky a lot of the weapon types feel while there are plenty of speedy alternatives like sword and shield long sword dual blades and insect glaive i would say that roughly half of the weapons embody the slow but powerful playstyle this aspect of the game is very much intentional and youll either love it or youll hate it as stated earlier there are alternatives but dont get discouraged if the first weapon you try isnt your cup of tea all that being said monster hunter world is in my opinion the best entry the series has to offer impeccable levelworld design complex and dynamic enemies a fantastic score and some of the best boss fights in gaming history its definitely one of my favorites go check it out,True,1389,371

76561198150695417,176278021,score 1010 monster hunter world comes close to perfection it has a few flaws like imperfect hitboxes unskippable cinematics and credits and the occasional frustration of missing loot drops because theyre hard to spot fortunately the game has an active modding community that helps address some of these issues the game truly shines in its gameplay and customization each weapon offers a unique playstyle allowing you to find what suits you best for me the bow hammer and switch axe were perfect each offering a different experience that kept the gameplay fresh this diversity in weapon mechanics makes it easy to replay the game without it feeling repetitive as each weapon introduces new ways to approach hunts in terms of design and story monster hunter world is richly detailed and immerses you in the role of a hunter exploring a new world the ecosystem feels alive with monsters engaging in territorial battles and even retreating to recover while sometimes frustrating when monsters run too often this can work to your advantage allowing you to strategize with traps the story is straightforward and easy to follow adding just enough context to the exploration each monster has unique traits and weaknesses making it rewarding to study and prepare for each hunt although the difficulty can be challenging careful preparationlike eating the right food crafting potions and setting trapsensures that every monster is beatable for experienced players diving straight into action and treating the game like a series of boss fights is a thrilling option overall monster hunter world is packed with content to enjoy at your own pace for just 20 euros the main game and dlc offer an incredible value and are well worth it,True,5652,5651

76561198023189786,176132582,i really enjoy this game if you are looking for a soulslike game with grinding where one shot can kill you and requires skillful dodging set in a world of monsters you must try this one you can hunt the same monster with many different weapons and in my opinion its even more enjoyable to play with others even if they arent your friends this is a monster hunter game that strikes a balance between realism and fantasy i like this much more than the rise title what i dont like about this title tactics around hunting dont seem to matter such as tracking the monster in the middle of the game it feels like youre just wasting time walking to their pathnest to fight the boss with a navigator trappingitem is only useful for capturing monsters to get more rewards or stun them you can simply build main on attack power and one build solves everything other tactics or features are more for fun i would prefer the game to increase the intensity by making each monster require a different approach to hunting demanding more preparation armor doesnt matter much if you can dodge everything most useful armor is lategame armor no one care much for small monster armors and theres no need to adapt skills or stats for different environments just make different way to increase atk power each weapons it may be one of the reason that game provides layered armor for customization looks the design of some armors and weapons feels out of theme it looks more like something from a fashion show or an other mmorpg with the same color of monsters some designs dont make me feel like they are part of the monster while eventcollab gear is acceptable i prefer armor and weapons that reflect the look of the monsters themselves part dropping feels repetitive only a few rewards require specific part destruction so you end up just killing as fast as possible until it drops without much strategy grinding to get gacha is very painful,True,33843,33843

76561199405296735,176020234,as a japanese in china i was expecting to try this monster hunter world of capcom but i was very disappointed that the experience this game brought me was far less than the game genshin impact from china this game is even suspected of copying genshin impact in many aspectsas a japanese i am very sad to see that the development of games in my country is so slow even lowquality games such as monster hunter can be over praised by people sometimes we should learn from the modest and noble character of the chinese people i strongly suggest that you experience genshin impact a great epochmaking game from china rather than a failed work like monster hunter world which makes the world see jokes it is evident that japans gaming development has fallen behind china by at least ten years there is a saying in china that cannot see the wood for the trees i think it is very suitable for japanese today you should experience genshin impact yourself so that you wont waste precious time in such a failed game as monster hunter world,False,4705,4474

76561198037513682,175999301,truthfully i love this game played it religiously on its original ps4 release and came to revisit and experience the stuff i didnt get to then after not liking rise very much if i didnt have hard nostalgia for 3u this would be my favourite monster hunter by a country mile however i still dearly wish steam had a sideways thumb option because while it does excel in many aspects in my eyes theyre in very peculiar niche ways that are uncommon if not detrimental to the experience one would want or expect from a monster hunter title and when it misses it misses hard especially now that its nearly a decade past its relevancy to be brief i find that worldborne is at its best if you enjoy it as a solo experience at your own pace and dont worry too much about getting super sweaty with gearing but that feels like an irresponsible rec considering what mh is as a series and what this particular game asks of the player along its progression mhw and its expac iceborne really endeared themselves to me personally because my favourite parts of 3u and 4u were the freehunting and the everwood expeditions so a whole game with those modes of hunting at the fore was so up my alley it was basically a turkey the joke with my friends was i have 500 hours and 499 of them are expeditions these and controversially the guiding lands in ibs endgame are absolutely perfect for me where often i reach points in these games when ive farmed everything i want or want to take a break from the grind but still want to play the game but dont really want or need to do anything specific just slap me in an expedition and ill become an extinction event for fun if you have those similar sorts of cravings of just wanting to dick around in something that feels good to play thisll scratch that hard i was also drawn into the series by its fascinating setting and worldbuilding so a more immersive experience exploring those in a more direct ways was exciting unfortunately this is where the first major hitch is which is that the progression hinges on the story mode directly but its set up such that players have to see the attached cinematics on their own before they can group up with friends the cutscenes are unskippable and the story is merely serviceable at best if youve played any other mh youll know the writings never been its strong suit if you dont have the taste for it the cinematic focus on it makes it feel a lot worse than it is and it makes multiplayer needlessly clunky for those wanting to coop the main campaign further hampering multiplayer is semiregular connection issues the next big hitch is that the general gearmechanical progression did not age well at all unlike past mhs there is a lot of npc chatter and tutorializing right out the gate and this continues even into endgame where certain encounters try to spice things up with different mechanics field gimmicks etc but they end up feeling patronizing to veterans and overwhelming to new and unfamiliar players speaking of the new player experience they default new characters to defender gear which is a huge noob trap absolutely do not use this if its your first time through the general pacing of the content without the forced downtime between title updates also makes their difficulty spikes that much harsher such as going from the base game campaign into icebornes campaign or when ibs endgame opens up a lot of this is compounded by the worldborne gearing system being something different compared to games prior or since but the lack of variety was rightfully criticized since the initial release and the general trend of entirely vertical gear progression thanks to tu powercreep is probably some of the worst gearing in the series the menuing in this game is also particularly poor sorting out your gearsets and item sets are way more convoluted than they need to be often the best gear comes from sieges which are an interesting take on wholelobby multiplayer but the avaliable quests cycle weeklyish as a liveserviceism and only one of the two is actually somewhat interesting to face with i think safijiiva might be one of the most boring fights in the series and im the type that willingly hunts ceadeus mh has historically had balance issues but its gotten frustrating since theyve reached a point where nothing is iunplayably badi but the stuff thats good is so head and shoulders above the rest its hard to avoid see ls in rise the biggest gammoth in the room with this is the clutch claw which completely trivializes lower ranks and neuters monster behaviors even if you dont actively use it thanks to the halfstun state they added to all mons to encourage use of it in usual mh fashion they had to design around it and other polarizing pieces like the temporal mantle to make things actually difficult come iceborne so youre either having to spam wallbangs to keep monsters downed 247 or are a masochist like me from the few weapons ive played between my files sa hammer and ig its a total crapshoot on whether or not ccing even feels good to begin with lastly the mtx is embarassing man sure its all optional cosmetics and stupid shit like room decor but so was horse armour theres over 500 of it and the game itself doesnt hesitate to let you know about it worst part about this is they show no signs of stopping since all people care about is dressup a lot of this is alleviated by the fact you can pick up world and ib for like 15 bucks rather frequently its a great game but it tries to have its cake and eat it too in many awkward and outdated ways its hard to recommend because its a great solo experience until it isnt at the expense of its multiplayer until it doesnt,False,25597,25320

76561198811328395,175760729,its fun as an action game but the multiplayer system is trash some of the quests essentially force you to play with other people and one of my biggest issues with this is the fact that sometimes connection errors occur randomly in the middle of the quest but the person isnt always able to rejoin especially if the online session fills up before they can rejoin for the more casual quests where multiplayer isnt heavily encouraged the hp of the monster scales up with the number of players unfortunately when a person leaves a quest the hp of the monster stays the same for example if a monster has 1000 hp with one player and then 2000 with 2 players if one of the players gets disconnected thus leaving the quest the monsters hp will remain at 2000 even though there is technically only one player in the quest aside from that there are certain bugs that are utterly frustrating like how the cat sometimes is in the middle of using the vigorwasp delivery but then suddenly stops for no apparent reason theres also a bug where the monster will run on the wall crushing the player underneath most of the time this will kill the player because you arent able to get away from the monster dive doge or heal because its flinching you from running on the wall there are times the monster also goes outside of the map where players cannot go and if this happens while you are riding the monster it makes you fall off but theres no way to prevent this from happening you just have to cross your fingers and hope the monster doesnt go outside the map,False,35628,34572

76561199653563114,175708454,an amazing game with many praise worthy qualities such as the beautiful visuals fantastic soundtrack and combat that is genuinely fun to get good at however there are several things that weigh the experience down the story forcing you to load into quests solo watch the unskippable cutscene then have you or your friend leave their instance in order to play together is a major pain point the lack of proper weapon tutorials hurts onboarding for new players as they need to consult third party guides just to understand how their weapon functions menus are annoying at best and unintuitive at worst while most of the issues ive mentioned so far are minor in the grand scheme of things a major gripe i have with the game has to do with the unequal treatment of weapons in regard to dealing elemental damage having half of your arsenal be objectively inferior to just using a weapon with more raw damage hurts build diversity and is incredibly disappointing when you want to build around a monsters weakness only to end up doing worse because your weapon isnt good for elemental damage also having the frostfang barioth charge blade be impact phial was just evil,True,21534,20810

76561197991294220,175248655,very playerunfriendly design choices ruin a possibly fun game experience first let me clarify that the initial review and the following is obviously subjective while i have a hard time having fun in this game you may very well have lets start with something minor you learn in a tutorial that to capture a monster you will have to use a particular item and use that once since you do not have enough knowledge in the beginning both in and out of the game to know when you should use it you may think it is not ready when you use it and it did not work in fact the tutorial is weirdly the only time a monster can be captured by using the item only once all other times you need to use it twice it seems like this could have been a rare case in which some circumstances were met so that one was enough but this through me off for a while resulting in not capturing monsters playing in multiplayer is annoying since creating a group and departing on a quest together is inconvenient since all players except the host will have to go to the quest board seperately to accept the quest there are several mechanics while fighting monsters which result in not being able to act stun paralyze sleep knockback and knockdown while you can avoid most attacks it is almost impossible to avoid all of them it is quite likely to get chaincced so that you cannot act for 10 seconds or so in a row then healing for 2 seconds if you are lucky to not get hit again while doing so there is a mechanic that can at least make yourself immune to the effects and most of them are monster specific so you can prepare yourself for those but stunning is quite common so having this resistance is almost necessary to have fun in this game i forgot to change that and played one quest without and immediatly noticed it the mechanic for having these resistances is locked to progression and limited slots this basically means that i will never remove those resistances and reducing the customization options for my build the interface and the controls are limited by console development this is extremely noticeable since the interface can be a pain to navigate especially using hotkeys for items to use is just nonsense assigning these hotkeys is needlessly complicated and tied to loadout which may result in overwriting the hotkeys you just assigned so you can do the process again even with those hotkeys it may not even be faster to use those instead of tediously scrolling through the permanently present bar of all items since pressing just one button is not enough first you need to press one hotkey for the bar itself to appear then you need to wait a second so it will recognize the pressed button and use the item adding to that keys have to be assigned multiple times due to the limited buttons on a controller this leads to unwanted actions like walking or sprinting and jumping outside of a fight results in a simple and quick dodge doing so in a fight is different walking does the same but sprinting and jumping will make the character dodge in a dive which may have more invincibility frames but also stun you for about two seconds in which you may then be hit which would not have happened otherwise i actually just found out that it even differs from fighting small enemies first behaviour and big enemies second behaviour another one is when changing from a melee weapon the bow the controls for the items have been remapped to those for the ammo and the items suddenly require more buttons to be pressed for them to scroll through while it may be possible that you could remap these manually i cant be sure since i wont try it out again the game is sluggish when using any weapon i have tried so far the bow is definitely no exception and felt completely unrewarding if i did hit when i started playing the game some controls didnt even work until i remapped a key to something else and then back while most of this may be due to console development i do not understand why you need to reequip your loadout and have to eat getting one buff for the upcoming quest manually before every single mission a simple option to use this or that loadout or current and use that meal while accepting or departing for a quest would save so much time running around and going through the inventory while on a mission you have access to almost everything from your equipment be it on your character or in your stash changing the weapon armor or loadout is available but swapping decorations for resistances or damage is not so if you forget to change one of those gems you will have to go back to the base and into the mission again and then there is this inconsistent design of showing stats the main point of the game is to build your equipment specialized to your preference to achieve that the game provides detailed percentages or flat numbers of damage or resistances from equipment or decorations this makes sense and then there are items which boost your damage or defence heal you or deal damage how much well you need to find out how long guess or time it yes this is not a big problem but i would like some consistency your palico which is an ai helping you as long as the party is below four players can be a life saver but also just be baiting you into your death there is a mechanic where it is obviously coming to give you much needed health but just before reaching you it just stops and denying you the heal this in combination with having the monster attacking your helper may result in death by betrayal of course the second part is something you need to be aware of but why would your palico just stop without any reason while most of this is not a major inconvenience by itself the amount is just killing a lot of fun there is still more that i do not like in this game but is not necessarily player unfriendly just questionable design,False,9620,9617

76561197975565331,175247821,this game is suffering from feature creep i got this game four years after release and it looked like a mess i couldnt tell what was the main game mode or what i was supposed to do and what was a microtransaction and what wasnt it was like it was fashioned to cater to longtime players not newbies this game is similar to horizon zero dawn in being breath of the wildy but its japanified its from capcom so you can bet theres a gruff lone wolf warrior a chirpy waifu assistant and cutesy mascot pets theres a huge world to explore but it gives you a little more guidance first this one also has you hunting dinosaurs i still dont get the online group aspect of it yet its a little more dark soulsish in that the monsters take a ton of hits to kill but needs little strategy and timing to kill them but they dont kill you in one hit so its more forgiving however the monsters take so many hits to kill its tedious i wonder if this game is meant for a younger audience like under 13 its a little simpler and there are kitty mascots who follow you around and you can dress up its part of the junk overhead that games haveherbs and crafting and cooking meat and online sessions and costumes you play a customized character so that takes away much motivation to see that character succeed because that character is you since youre customized you have no backstory no motivation no needs or wants and thus no personality you are your avatar but you dont know why youre hunting these monsters you dont have anything to drive you its why i couldnt get into choose your own adventure books i dont want to read or watch movies or play video games to be me i want to escape into someone else,False,154,154

76561198006266090,175234745,my first monster hunter game overall a great experience the core gameplay is fantastic if you like hitting monsters until they fall over good content outside of simply hunting as well if youre a completionist comprehending the uis and all the systems became awkward and frustrating initially as a keyboardmouse player however its easy to immerse yourself in the world if you invest your time grinding for upgrades can be a chore but the gameplay and variety of every hunt makes the grind very enjoyable,True,142069,138536
76561198141165016,175234408,i dont know how it has taken me this long to write a view for this masterpiece of a game when my friend first showed this game to me on release it didnt take my fancy as i just saw it as an anime game tldr mhw is a beautiful game with an addictive gameplay loop and iceborne gives you even more of the base game to play through i highly recommend anyone who likes the look of the trailers to pick it up mhw as a lone game is fantastic the core gameplay revolves around venturing out into 1 of 5 7 with dlc areas and hunting these large monsters that wonder the landscape this game is part of an overall series but as someone who has yet to play any other mh games you dont need to have played previous games in fact this is probably the best starting point my favourite aspects of the game every monster is somewhat believable they all interact with their environment whether that be fighting for land with other monsters scratching their back against a tree eating some meat or just patrolling around their territory every monster feels real and like it doesnt just exist for quest objective sake but rather it was already there and needed to be dealt with to add onto this point the actual design and aesthetic of each monster is amazing from the lowly great jagras all the way up to nergigante fatalis and namielle every monster has a cool design the gameplay loop is incredibly addictive its fairly basic on paper load into the map and run around until you either find the monster or find tracks that will then lead you to the monster once located you beat it into a small paste or it does that to you and then you go back to the main base area what makes it so addicting is the combat itself as a hunter you have access to 14 different types of weapon that each have their own combos moves unique characteristics and styles of fighting every monster also has its own unique attacks that take time to memorise and learn the patterns of but once you perfect both you feel awesome as you leap block jump smash slice and brutalise the monster until its barely recognisable the gear progression in this game is great whilst the endgame has a heavy emphasis on minmaxing your skills to get the highest damage possible the actual progression throughout the game is really well implemented every monster you kill has several armour sets that match its design and has skills that somewhat reflect the monsters behaviours you find yourself hunting the same monster repeatedly as you farm it for the materials in order to make the next sword or armour piece that you need to be able to beat the next monster the landscape and map design is absolutely phenomenal whilst no cyberpunk 2077 mhw still keeps up with the games being released 6 years later from the sprawling green maze that is the ancient forest to the boiling lava lakes and crystalline structures of the elders recess this game continues to amaze me with how gorgeous it is and this is only further enhanced by the monster design as mentioned earlier what could be better the story is somewhat lackluster dont go into this game expecting fallout nv cyberpunk or rdr2 levels of story telling the story is good but for the most part its told via on screen text and unskippable cutscenes please capcom its been 6 years let me skip them it is based around the mystery of the elder crossing and finding out why these incredibly powerful monsters are being drawn to the new world its a good premise and is somewhat interesting but for the most part i was focused on beating up the next monster so i could get myself a new hat its somewhat complex the weapon tree can be slightly daunting at first glance with there being so many different weapons with different numbers symbols colours etc once you go and google what they mean or read the in game tutorials which are length it is understandable and you realise you can ignore 80 of the weapon tree as they arent as good as the other 20 monster hunter more like menu hunter when you arent fighting a monster you are fighting against the menus you will spend so much time sorting out your item box taking your crafting items out of your botanical box making custom meals organising your load outs and item wheel for different monsters locales and weapons whilst i dont think this should put you off buying this game it certainly can be an unexpected aspect of the game to new players that can be quite confusing monster hunter world iceborne further amplifies the base game it is essentially monster hunter world 2 being the same length if not longer than the base game and adding in tons of new and returning monsters to hunt the story is again pretty middling but if you enjoy the base game it is definitely worth picking up iceborne too just dont use guardian or defender gear as its designed to be op in order to get you to iceborne quicker overall mhw is an amazing game that i would recommend everyone play,True,24980,18252

76561198332469216,175201384,dont get into this game its not what i would call a bad game but it kinda sucks for one the game really does not respect your time if you are here for epic bossfights you are not getting them at least not without grinding for hours and since the game is not a normal rpg where you would at least get xp by killing monsters if you dont get what you were looking for guess what you wasted your time go fight that bullshit monster again oh and you can not skip cutscenes even if you have seen it before are you very bad at fighting this story boss well fuck you you are tanking the cutscene every time ok whatever i will just play with friends it should be fun anyway first of all what game is not fun with good friends also there is not much of actual cooperation in fights like sure you could have someone drag aggro god knows how and a support and stuff and try to act like its a mmo raid but it will never feel like one because 90 of the time you are just smacking the boss and the rest 9 you are doing stuff like healing that generally does not affect other players now you can go out of you way to be a support and help your allies but its mostly buffing the game is clearly not designed gameplay wise for complex coop multiplayer is very lacking in general this is ignoring the horrible multiplayer system that this game uses im not even goin to get into it because i have no fucking clue how to make a proper session to play with my friends in my defense they quit playing so i didnt get many oportunities i do remember that to do story quest with friends you need to start the quest alone then after finishing the wow look at this cool monster also why is my character brain damaged unskippable cutscenetm only after that do you get to summon your friend at least its not like in dark souls also if for some reason there is a disparity in gear level you will notice it now this is an extreme example but i was about to be done with the first 13 of the base game and i was doing a story quest with my friend and i randomly saw an odogaron now i have been trying to farm these but at that moment in time they were about as strong as the stronger enemies i was fighting so i tell my friend if we can kill it he is not the mission target so he says yea and you know begins charging a range attack with his gun bow idk and now for more context my friend was deep in the dlc by this point if i was in 13 of the game he was in the 43 of it now if you played this game you know where this is going but for the people that havent my friend shot the boss that took me about 25 to 30 minutes to kill in previous instances and just oneshot it almost every multiplayer game i have played went like this less exaggerated but still there is no power cap or anything if you need help you can literally just summon god to do your bidding its its pretty terrible system horrible even some enemies are just kind of shit to fight in the dlc is downright horrible but even some base game monsters also just suck there are a few that fly for half the fight and sure you can knock them out and stun them with consumables but this is not the fucking witcher i dont wanna have to come to every boss with perfect equipment its a hasle and there isnt even that many options like you would think there would be a special harpoon trap to counter flying monsters or like poisonous caltrops that counter excepcionally fast monsters or anything really there are two traps a bunch of explosive barrels that all do the same thing in different flavour of damage numbers how original poisonparalysissleep daggers and and what the consumables that you are forced to carry unless you wanna fucking die i swear if you told me that there are only 3 more consumables in this game than in the 3ds monster hunter that had gore magala i would believe you its so lacking and boring also there is no auto restock you are picking up your fucking 20 items that you used up in the previous hunt manually every single time even though it would be obscenely easy to add to the game the option to auto restock also you have to eat in the canteen or if you are lucky inside the camp and the system just kind of sucks balls if the food is not max quality you are literally missing 50 hp points that is like a third of your base hp and you will need to use annoying consumables that if you happen to die in the mission you will have to consume again like you could say well its a monster hunting game where you need to plan around for the hunt but its fucking not you prep like once every 5 hunts because the survival mechanics of the game either ruin the game or are just there im not saying that they should remove the hunger bar that one is fine you just eat rations but why the fuck are you missing a chunk of your max health it does not go down as time goes does not go down as you get hurt does not go down as you are poisoned either it only does down when you go down so now you either gotta eat at camp again or do the multiple chug of shame where you need to chug an item that you never want to carry because it has no in combat effectwhy is this a thing sure im used to it and everyone and their mother who plays this game probably is too but every person who is new to the game holy fuck it sucks balls the only reason why nobody complains about this is because dealing with it is second nature or you dont get to play the game but it adds nothing to it its null void even fucking remove or rework there is no reason whatsoever for you to carry max hp restorers in combat either remove the system entirely or make the player tankier but every now and then you need to cure your wounds restore max hp and only if you get hit not the fucking oh shit gotta eat at the start of quest and if i dont i basically have the cancer holy shit this is a long rant anyways tldr shitty farming shitty multiplayer shitty enemies shitty systems shitty cutscenes and also most important of all the handler fucking sucks,False,6819,6819

76561198047280319,174908741,so i played a bit of this and mh4u before moving to rise first just as context i came back to this game after finishing risemidlategame as a bit of a warmup before wilds drops ive played up to defeating kushula dorahr i think that this is a great game overall when compared to rise the standout differences are massively more detailed aesthetics immersive worldbuilding and immensely satisfying graphics inout of combat really it just looks sounds and feels so much better to hit monsters in world as for the more negative differences rise includes massively increased flexibility in combat flow and customization that world doesnt have as well as more qol for picking up too many items it also gives players crutches through having palicos and palamutes and adjustable skillsets for both basically it allows for a more fluid gameplan when playing solo additionally the aspect of needing to equip health boostsworld instead of just acquiring a peletacerise to increase max hp partially restricts your available build i would say that defensive stats are valued even more in world and the ways to acquire those stats are also harder this adds to the grind of world even in the midgame purely from feeling too fragile to fight monsters this could be a symptom of me being a hammerlongsword playeror just being bad the clutch clawand other tools allow for very interesting combat interactions vastly different from wirebug usage however wirebugs increase the power level of both offense and defense giving players a bigger crutchlike how ppl complain about drive rush in sf6 the overall aesthetic of the world monsters and available gear feel much more grounded than rise making those who prefer the specific aesthetic of world love it that much more rise on the other hand feels more fantasyesque my other gripes with world include how many systems there are for passive material income it does allow for a healthy spending of research pointskamura points equivalent but is also kind of a weird hassle to keep remembering all of them and juggling them additionally i now understand why people who play world complain so much about decorations rise has a much more convenient way of acquiring decorations as you can craft a bunch en masse in world you have to instead just randomly get decorations from quests and synthesize specific decorations through melting down the random decorations that you dont need this creates another layer of obfuscation and difficulty in acquiring decoration setsprimarily defensive ones for any situation weapon crafting and upgrades are also designed a little weirdly compared to the ui of weapon creation in rise combining forging and upgrading in the same page theyre separated in world making understanding what you have available to upgradeor what you want unclear at a glance finally although this is probably part of the charm of world resources arent just randomly stockpiled to the point that you dont have to think about them too hard instead gathering resources and more importantly knowing where to gather resources is a crucial aspect of the game to know so overall world is quite a good game its much more grindy in the earlymidgame compared to rise the aesthetics and attention to detail are also a 1010 but the improved graphics bump that up a notch above rise i give it an overall 7510 its just a personal opinion and at the very least i can see why its a good game loved by many it doesnt have the lasting impact for me but maybe im just too much of a zoomer i just hope that wilds will combine the best of both world and risewhich kind of seems like the case actually give that rating a 1 we got real food in world i missed having that after playing rise,True,2718,2654

76561198144499611,174843011,monster hunter world does a great deal to actualise the childhood dream what would it be like to fight a dragon and it absolutely nails the delivery especially when it comes to the sheer magnitude of size and presence such creatures possess on top of this it doesnt shy away from the difficulty that fighting such intimidating creatures present and it rewards the smart hunter for diligently preparing themselves before a fight the arguably grindy but addictive gameplay loop that monster hunter has to offer will bring you back for more and more even after having played hundreds of hours and it still manages to surprise you with new angles and strategies for taking on even the smallest of foes as an experienced hunter i felt monster hunter world hit a nice balance it has a learning curve that will keep newer players attention without overloading them too early and is challenging enough come late game to keep even veteran hunters excited for more placing you in the shoes of a rookie hunter in the fifth fleet it is your job to support and protect the research commission in the monolithic task of establishing a foothold among the wilds of the new world and documenting all it has to offer it is here that the commission begins to discover a strange habit shared among the legendary elder dragons it sees them migrate to the new world once every ten years in an event called the elders crossing a very strange and not well known series of phenomena along the way the fifth fleet finds themselves following the elder dragon zorah magdaros in the process of its migration to the new world and decides that this momentous occasion should be documented to better understand the purpose behind such strange behaviours the story of monster hunter world isnt its strongest point often doing very little to explain the purpose behind hunting each of these monsters other than the broad concept of researching them all while following closely behind zorah magdaros through five different ecosystems i personally never found myself latching onto any of the concepts that monster hunter world attempted to explore instead i found myself more excited to discover which strange creature i would be pitted against next this resulted in me skipping a large portion of the monotonous textbased dialogue sprinkled throughout hunts along with the games very sporadic and strangely paced cinematics it seemed more of an obstacle between me and those thrilling fights that put you up against a whole host of memorable monstrosities this sadly resulted in a forgettable story that i wanted to fall in love with but found itself falling into mediocrity even at the time of writing this review im still ruminating at just how much further the monster hunter world experience could have been elevated by a well thought out story to accompany this supposed labour of love for those who developed it even after hundreds of hours on the clock monster hunter world still feels really good to play it isnt hard to see why even now six years after releasing and with the imminent release of monster hunter wilds next year why so many people are still flocking to experience and even replay monster hunter world with its easy to learn yet hard to master systems giving hunters the edge over its larger and much deadlier foes monster hunter world finds a unique depth that isnt captured by a game anywhere else the hardest decision youll make during your time in any entry into the monster hunter franchise is figuring out which of the 14 distinctly different weapons youll take along with you on your journey throughout my time with monster hunter world i took great joy in managing to learn how to wield 3 out of the 14 total weapons on offer and even now thousands of hunts later i can say it only felt like i drew close to mastering 1 of the three weapons i used this combined with a boastful catalogue of 71 different monsters after the addition of iceborne makes monster hunter world a veritable behemoth of a game without explaining the complexity of its item and armour crafting systems gem decoration and 3 world tier systems if it doesnt already the idea of monster hunter world begins to border on daunting when you consider that the experience changes once again when you trade your palico companion for other hunters should you decide to take this journey on with friends astoundingly enough all this information plus more is spoon fed to you throughout your journey in a way that is manageable and makes more sense the longer you stick with it to conclude monster hunter world is more than a simple game about hunting monsters its a genre defying journey that captures an experience that is exclusive only to the monster hunter franchise the minutes quite easily bleed into hours as you find yourself enthralled in its gather hunt and craft cycle that effectively makes you feel stronger as you progress hunts that once seemed insurmountable slowly begin to give way and it almost feels like you had found the missing pieces to that puzzle you were struggling with for so long i can still remember how intimidated i felt when first experiencing each of the base games regional apex monsters only to now compare them to the truly monstrous arch tempered elder dragons and i will never forget the challenges that awaited me in icebornes master rank hunts challenges that were true testaments to game knowledge and experience after nearly 300 hours worth of time spent on monster hunter world i still find myself excited at the prospect of jumping into monster hunter wilds next year however i would just as happily spend another 300 hours in monster hunter world learning one of the other 11 weapons i had yet to play with i can personally recommend monster hunter world to both new and experienced hunters looking to sink their teeth into a lengthy experience what youll find is both challenging and rewarding and with how frequently monster hunter world and its expansive iceborne dlc are available on sale often with heavy discounts its a no brainer for anyone looking for something fresh and exciting,True,17295,17295

76561198066466657,174710644,i wanted to give this game a good review because it is genuinely fun at times the gear you can craft is cool the move sets are all great and it does feel good to take on big monsters with my buddies however the one consistent problem this game seems to have is centered around its storyline missions the assigned quests are the only method to progress to higher levels of the game and also serve as the storyline for the whole thing while officially introducing the various monsters you then hunt as you progress the problem is that these monsters are all just as tough in the story missions as they would be if you encountered them in this games version of free roaming this means that you will inevitably hit a wall where something twotaps you because you didnt bother keeping all of your gear at the highest level you could possibly hit at the time at that point youve got two options option one is to spend hours grinding material for better armor weapons and support equipment just to clear a single hunt while option two is to call in a highlevel hunter to carry you through with little effort on your part the first one is frustrating to no end as you constantly have to spend hours gathering materials to craft and upgrade your gear for almost every assigned hunt past normal difficulty turning the game into a neverending grind before youve even hit the endgame material meanwhile the second just leaves me feeling like the whole thing is pointless because at that point im not the one clearing the content its the other player doing it for me and if thats what it takes to clear the missions and see what happens then why am i bothering to play the game at all all capcom would have needed to do was dial them back a bit for these story missions maybe less health lower defense stats something so that its possible to clear them without feeling like i need to spend hours reworking my entire setup while mastering dark soulslevel reflexes in order to stand a chance instead im left with either beating my head against a wall or asking my buddies to carry my worthless ass because ive grown tired of doing the former,False,10776,4270

76561197982521010,174458371,this is the first monster hunter game i play except for a psp release a long time ago but i remember giving up quickly because of the difficulty and complex system this game felt a little bit overwhelming at first since i had to learn every mechanic from the beginning but in my opinion its beginner friendly enough to let you keep playing even when you barely know what you are doing epecially since you get a very op set of armor and weapons pretty much right from the start choosing to play with the defender equipment makes the game super easy but that way you get a chance to actually learn the game before it gets more difficult and still have a chance to make your own equipment in the endgame the graphics are great but perhaps they should have made it a little bit more realistic the halfrealistic halfcartoon style of graphics feel a bit conflicting the story is very thin it feels more like an mmo than a single player rpg,True,3100,2504

76561198151370837,174436040,the combat in this game is very fun very very fun all the monsters feel different and it is nice to learn all their patterns all of the weapons feel distinct and there is very likely one that you will enjoy hint if you think that this game feel clunky or bad switch off of the gun lance and onto another weapon also you can cancel the end lag of a lot of moves with a dodge roll however the story is just plain bad and normally i wouldnt care since im a gameplay story kinda guy but it is incredibly intrusive in this game unskippable cutscenes forced walking segments with zero gameplay that last around 10 minuets each characters constantly telling you what to do so on and so forth also the number one stupidest thing is that this game thrives in coop yet you cant actually play through the story together since all of the story missions are solo until each person watches all of the cutscenes why i have no idea it really could not have been that hard to just put more than one person in a cutscene at the same time also most of the fights in this game are great but a select few cough zorah magdaros cough have some of the most mind numbing gameplay of all time weapons can also be unintuitive to learn the game doesnt actually tell you much about the weapon and some of the attacks arent even visible in the training range i have 30 hours on hammer and i just now found out about the clutch claw followup off of a standing max charge the game kicks into full gear when you hit high rank which is when the game sort of sets you free and you arent as constrained by the story overall id say this game is worth it playing it with friends is a ton of fun if you can get past the story throwing itself in your face,True,13194,1882
76561199018036951,174434511,monster hunter world is the most iconic entry in the monster hunter franchise the game has beautiful settings amazing ambience and an absolutely fantastic soundtrack the monster designs are awesome and their behaviour feels so real they have mannerisms behavioural patterns and special interactions a surprising one is that sometimes you can find anjanath staring off into the sunset the weapon designs are good but could be better as a lot of them feel repetitive especially with the greatswords but you can easily fix that with mods the collaborations are really fun too such as with the witcher and final fantasy the game is endlessly replayable and always a blast the story is heavily criticised and i agree with most of them however i would make the point that the story does work it may be a bit basic but it helps to tie everything together and the pacing feels right iceborne feels like a whole new game and brings back many old fan favourites overall i love this game and would really recommend everyone to play it just dont pick longsword lol i cant wait to see where the franchise goes and im thoroughly excited for monster hunter wilds in 2025,True,28812,9704

76561198208084497,174420200,ill start by saying im writing this with world being my first mh game and after logging 250 hours of total playtime across multiple characters with my most recent character being around mr 165 i first played world shortly after iceborne released on ps4 and couldnt really get into it at the time there were a lot of things i didnt understand at the time about the game or the patience needed to truly enjoy the game i tried again once i got my pc this past year in december and while i didnt truly enjoy the game when playing solo these past few months have allowed me to interact with the community and friends who enjoy the game and series bringing a new light on what it means to play monster hunter some of the chief complaints i see on the steam reviews from as recent as the past 30 days as of writing this talk about armor designs slow combat and gameplay or the tediousness of not being able to skip cutscenes not being able to join certain main story quests until after cutscenes from the person who is doing it for the first time and illwritten story while the complaints regarding the cutscene skips and quest join settings are understandable a majority of this is only affected by people playing the game for the very first time and chooses to largely ignore the overall picture of the game the story leaves a lot to be desired but it doesnt really take away from the gameplay other than ruining your immersion during your initial playthrough the general gameplay loop of the game is simple gather resources prep kill the monster make better gear repeat this game a lot of options in it to customize your builds and change the way you fight while some armorsets and weapons stand out a bit from the rest youll be able to constantly improve through the simple act of gathering prepping hunting as you progress youll encounter bigger and more dangerous monsters that serve as a mark of how strong you really are as for combat the controls might feel extremely slow or clunky for a game that involves fighting monsters when you first start out the only way i can think of describing the combat system with a simple phrase is opportunistic engagement while i am reluctant to make the comparison since the games are two completely different genres one might see the patience needed to take advantage of certain openings the monster leaves as soulslike that said the intensity of this gameplay is much different and more action focused and you are able to create many more opporunities through your weaponskills the environment and items in order to lay the monster down into beat town having gotten much better at the game since starting and even watched a few hours worth of speedrunning explanations on youtube i can happily say that the more you play the smoother your gameplay will feel each weapon is a fine art ready to be refined in its own unique way with tricks that might not appear so easily to a first glance i hope if you do pick up the game you find a weapon that suits your style and can make the most of it i would encourage anyone interested in the series to give world and further along iceborne a try some of my favorite parts of this game are being able to grapple onto the monster and take advantage of tenderizing a monster part to deal more damage and just the amazing music in the background for some of the fights if i had to list the things i dislike about the game it would probably amount to there not being any crossplay and sometimes the servers for the game shit themselves a bit,True,20984,15112

76561198045196300,174396938,monster hunter world was my first introduction to this long running franchise and for my first time playing a game of this kind its certainly a welcoming experience for newcomers especially with mh wilds on the horizon i find myself coming back to worlds because of its accessibility and still highly active playerbase i may not be the most experimental player with me mostly preferring long swords and dual blades but that only scratches the surface for the many options at your disposal ranging from bows clubs great swords and instruments which is further achieved by the numerous armor options you can obtain throughout your journey i will say i hate the lack of a skip cut scene option since a lot of cut scenes are painfully drawn out so much so that i can prepare food in the interim while they play out but besides that you will find a community of people that love playing together to take down big monsters with the promise of earning far greater gear its the ultimate practice of rewarding players for their hard work and its truly intoxicating monster hunter world has character character that will keep people engaged especially 6 years after its release and its iceborne expansion perfectly enriches the experience even further highly recommend,True,8581,5916

76561198030904505,174304667,summary 8510 a veteran hunter of the arpg genre mhw and iceborne finish with a decent track record the big name of monster hunting games finally came to pc and had a major impact in popularizing this gamestyle so much so that prior inspired series like toukiden which came to pc long before it from omega force dropped their own unique and beloved niche style and tried to copy it this led to the horrible failure known as wild hearts and the current unknown fate of a once interesting competitor in toukiden with this selfinflicted defeat of their rivals under eas leadership the iceborne expansion offered hunters more of the same and a few new entries mostly adapted from older game entries in the series while this is not an issue the repetitive alternates did leave some things desired and felt lazy at certain aspects some of these alternates barely differ from their original with the biggest outlier being seething beezlegeuse with its growing napalm mines overall the game has a weird pace it was made easier with iceborne to skip the base game and it uses high sharpness and blast weapons defender weapons for this this led to many hunters arriving in iceborne with little knowledge of damage diving or proper evasion and preparation combined with the new clutch claw feature considering the strict difficulty curve of the shorter resting times of monsters and their higher immunity to stuns and other issues this is a dangerous cocktail thankfully many veteran hunters are willing to pick up the slack leading to most of them still being effectively pulled through the game this can be a positive and they are allowed to play solo if they want for the challenge either way the old feeling of everyone fighting the curve is now over as long as you dont die people will even kill alatreon for you by staying behind in camp or out of danger with their endgame gear for those braving the challenge of doing the story solo and being a true sapphire star the game has many systems to upgrade equipments and later to equip specific gems to plan ahead for each monster or to just build a general resistance gear with earplugs tremor resistance stun resistance and flinch resistance and blight resistance many ignore this one still with the slowly upgrading armor system and augmentation system former tough challenges of two hits become doable repeated farm battles which often end in grinds for certain sets or weapons this is one of the main weaknesses of the game the high requirements for rare drops in many recipes which have to be done in battle or through golden investigations many events change periodically and give extra loot in the lategame the steamworks lootbox gives tons of bombs tranquilizers and healing in iceborne much of the preparations of the base game have been made obsolete for good or for worse what hasnt changed base game to iceborne is the hitboxes the monsters still use damage cones which means even if they dont hit you if you are on the wrong side of the damage cone and inside of its heigh you get hit stuff you feel shouldnt hit you or not as hard will do exactly that this especially in iceborne with the high attack frequency will feel unfair something toukiden strangely did better even back then you will get used to it hopefully to brave this issue you will have tons of weapons to learn and use or you do it like me and only use the dual blades the flashiest of weapons if heavily nerfed in iceborne the story is decent nothing to write home about its written akin to monster of the week or rather monster of the chapter type style with some minor roles given to minor monsters the main bread and butter of the story are the great cinematic cutscenes with you in the center unless you play your story mission in a group then the group leader is in the center if you want great screenshots play them solo first the sound design and music is decent but sometimes feels out of place even for the steampunk of this world while many events have immersion breaking themes and outfits the crossovers are made with care and are really interesting especially the ff xiv and witcher 3 crossover for completionists you will be long done with everything but the rank grind and to save yourself the pain the event quests rotten canzone 15 ranks and the circus 08 rank give decent mr for 2025 and 1015 minutes respectively its still odd that not only is the road to 200 repetitive and boring the quests to fill out that grind come every 25 ranks and are for one specific item upgrade the pace is sadly horrible in iceborne and that will not be changed the game is finished my personal ranking for this game is finish it completing it is only for the truly dedicated,True,45191,45191

76561198105802335,174168578,monster hunter as a series is beloved by me but im gonna try and stay unbiast here i started playing with world when i got it as a birthday present and ever since that really fell in love with the series im gonna start with the cons because its best to know about the downsides before you get sucked in to what makes the game good overall compared to some of the other games that are like it ie souls like games monster hunter world is pretty easy there was drm that was added along with the iceborne update that really hinders performance and is against mods nevertheless the mods proceeded but it overall was a performance tank to mhw along with its other problems the story is not really that good as its just mostly go and kill thing ok cool now that thats done kill different thing though thats oversimplified the weapon designs for most of base mhw are terrible as they are just some bone weapons or metal ones with a bit of the monsters part attatched and not much else though around endgame iceborne the weapon designs are pretty cool and lastly the game can be seen as very grindy as you have to fight the same monster over and over maby even 56 times just to get a full set or a weapon that you want though i find that to tie in well to its gameplay loop ill get into that later ok on to the pros first of all the game looks amazing if you can run it 2nd mhw is king for having little interactions all throughout the game that are never really noted and figuring them out is really satisfying like for example did you know that tsitzi yakus nest has reflective shells that do actually reflect its flashbang stuff like this is everywhere and makes the whole world feel alive 3rd the game allows you to be able to see your progress everytime you fight a monster each and every time you have to re fight a monster you will learn more about their moveset and after every clear of the hunt the next one gets easier than the last and thats simply because your adapting to it and getting more knowledge of the fight and lastly the game is best played with freinds ive done solo playthroughs and id have to say that being able to hype up your buddies after they get a cool hit in that knocks down the monster or be able to save somebody from being stunned with an upward swing to being able to combo a monster with 3 other people is a fantastic feeling though not everybody has freinds that can play with them to conclude this monster hunter world is a more freindly souls like game and i say that really loosly that encourages coop behavior and allows you and your freinds to overcome challenges together with a kickass soundtrack playing throughout side note ive seen a lot of people saying that world is better than rise and rise is better than world and honestly its just a prefrence to both world has a more slower paced combat and people might like that rise has a more arcade feel to it and others perfer that there both good games its just which one youd perfer,True,8582,4716

76561198218589075,174084715,a masterpiece pretty good game without iceborne but iceborne elevates it to one of my favorite games of all time sure its kinda grindy and can get repepetitive but the variety of weapons negates this each weapon feels like a whole new experience although the real star of the show is the final boss of the game the last title update fatalis honestly the greatest boss fight in the history of games imo even if you disagree you cant deny its up there at least its a long journey to even start fighting him and its extremely difficult but the feeling of activating the dragonpiercer and hearing proof of a hero then the final hit on him and the quest complete music as someone who has played most souls games it dwarfs the feeling of beating any of those bosses its like beating consort radahn or malenia but on steroids that said i have nearly 100 hours on pc and have only just beat the initial boss of iceborne i have around 700 800 hours on console its a long journey to fatalis but its not like its not fun initial walls like anjanath and nergigante are harrowing experiences not on the same level as fatalis but still amazing especially nergigante basically gather a friend or two and start this wonderful game immediately theres still a large enough playerbase that you can get people to help out theres even incentives for players to help with particularly hard monsters like the elder dragons and once you get to siege monsters and fatalis you can find lobbies meant to help people do them theres even lfg discords full of helpful people its still a long wait for wilds but until then we still have this gem to tide us over,True,5786,5676

76561197995846340,174039909,picked it up in 2024 i love it hard to explain why but ive seen many elden ring players come to this game in their hangover after the dlc is it hard up to you till the end credits of the dlc the difficulty is more about gearing than the monsters every time i hit a wall i would go farm the correct weapon with the correct gear farm more to upgrade them all go back to clear it but there is an entire game after the credits thats where skill planning requirements go up you can decide if you want to stop when the credits roll for now im planning to stop at mr100 currently 77 can be a bit overwhelming to see all the quest markers when you start but once you get into it its actually quite simplistic and flexible in the approach you want to take one final thing i played single player till the end of base game only tried multiplayer in iceborne while you can play alone playing in a group makes everything much more fun and easier when the monster isnt focused on you all the time dont have to be too chatty if you dont want to a few polite hi hellos and do your own job well is what most people want highly recommended,True,17316,14629

76561198112694877,173965450,in short garbage story clunky combat system lazy monster designs ugly weapons armors designs its just not fun dont bother oh boys if you cant do compelling story then just dont you can just let the players decide on their own as for what to do in the land full of dangerous monsters and unexplored territories but instead of that you conjured a garbage halfbaked story which by the way would have been fine if it were to be optional or multiple side stories that players can discover on their own and not having everything locked behind it this makes the game not about monster hunting anymore instead it becomes oh we have to save the world so we must kill x oh then kill y too kill z next maybe rename it to monster mercenary so it would fit the game play combat system is very terrible every action locks you in place whether its from a dagger or a hammer although the animations from lighter weapons are faster but thats kinda irrelevant because it locks you in place anyway you cant really land the last hit of the chain because the time it takes for each swing is ridiculous and despite being hit by the longwindingandbuildup heavylooking swing on the weak point they dont stagger they fucking wont but you do and no matter how small the attack is if you get hit then youll be on the ground hell you dont even have to get hit they flap their wings and you are stunned the element system is kinda pointless it doesnt do anything really different element is just different color fire doesnt burn ice doesnt slow poison does damage but blast also does damage but in different color etc etc for a game that call itself monster hunter you would expect various kind of monsters in reality if they look roughly the same the they are the same and lots of them look very similar to each other its just different skin of the same monster but more aggressive same move set but attack more frequent even if theyre fucking elder dragons they still have the same moves if they look similar to a low level wyvern armors and weapon are an eyesore they look nothing like what they actually are maybe you can justify that by making them look like they come from parts of monster because theyre made form materials from that monster but thats not the case either theyre just outright ugly 25,False,7063,7017

76561198884315286,173928648,im analyzing this game based on how it compares to the rest of the monster hunter series im being slightly bitter but i do love the game and i have purchased it and iceborne both on pc and ps4 pros it is the most popular mh game and has the most players online compared to the previous generation nearly every aspect of gameplay has been improved upon to feel smother and more accessible the unique tracking mechanic is actually very intuitive and kinda fun to engage with the new armor skill system the faster weapon movesets rolling backwards and stepping forwards the base games slinger the item wheel the added details to the monster field guide and many more features are very welcome always having access to the map the ability to mark monsters and show gathering points on the map gathering tools the canteen the ability to change equipment and the contents of your item pouch while on the hunt are improvements to the experience hot take i did not like running out of pickaxes or whetstones being able to access all of this on the new expeditions as a former moga woods and everwood enjoyer is extremely nice the endemic life and environmental details set this title apart as the currently bestlooking and most interesting to take at a slower pace it has a very active modding scene with awesome people like the resurgence team bringing entirely new monsters to the game i wish capcom would endorse it but seeing as 80 of the other mods for this game are nsfw i understand why they dont cons clutch claw i dont like explaining how tenderizing and flinch shots are essential to people who have over 100 hours logged in a game i wish the iceborne community edition mod went all the way and just reduced monster hp and removed flinch shots altogether guiding lands more like grinding lands i am not spending 700 hours to max it out are you kidding me the narrative is a conquistador simulator yes i can capture all the monsters but i always feel icky hunting kulve taroth in the literal caverns of el dorado if this is supposed to be an mmo why do most sessions only have 1 or 2 players and no one ever talking to each other cutscenes blocking multiplayer huge step back the monster research segments were poorly executed and came off as frustrating rather than encouraging you to do optional quests and expeditions rip greatsword and hunting horn for the game to run reasonably well you need to install two mods from nexus strackers loader and performance booster plugin extender many players are not aware that using the defender weapons and guardian armor trivializes progression and the learning curve and they fail to improve their skills until much later than expected the tutorialization is annoying and leads most players to ignore crucial details like how to beat alatreon and build effective armor sets while this game is very good and you will have fun with it if you put in the several hundred hours it asks of you as all mh games do rise has almost all of the features i consider pros and almost none of the cons so if youre a new player i actually think you should play that one instead,True,12224,11302

76561199229292553,173911905,this a fun game about abusing monsters doing quests about abusing monsters and making sick armor and weaponry from their remains i bought the game with the iceborne dlc and at first i wasnt so sure on this game some friends told me to play it with them and so i did slowly after a couple play sessions i really liked the game i even went and bought some more gesture packs and stuff so my friends and i could troll each other the designs sound tracks and animations of each monster and creature in the world makes the fights and random creatures you encounter feel great like each battle was grand and important plus the dynamics change if you have teammates whether it be friends or random people on top of that the dynamics change even more based on everyones weapon choice im personally a fan of the insect glaive and bow genre of weapons in this game however people can pick up really annoying weapons to fight along side my friends and i had a joke for every time we saw people we would help out with those weapons of course use what you want i dont care its just we always had bad experiences with players who used certain weapons such as longsword if youre picking up this game id advise to stick strictly to yourself and the friends you may play this game with if you have none you can try joining random people on expeditions or who need help in certain quests as some quests feel like youd really want at least a single teammate on and other feel best alone then rarely some feel like youd want as many friends as possible the more people the more likely everyone is to get in the way of each other but if you have enough communication and experience with each other and your tools then it can be more than fantastic the armor and weapons all from what i can tell look beautiful i personally had a goal set for both my insect glaive and bow category getting every weapon in whatever tree i choose and adding as many to my collection as possible same with armor i never sold any armor however with iceborne dlc i have a few complaints about the armor you can make whatever armor you can afford really but the skin types of armor i forget what the cosmetic armor that goes over your actual armor is called can only be used at the end of the game after i already did everything then youre allowing me to look the way i want brother im done with the game theres nothing else well okay not entirely true i didnt do everything the game had to offer however when something popped up like a quest i wanted to do or a certain monster i wanted to fight or an event that appeared i did them i dont want to do anymore when im already done with the game plus the game is a constant battle against harder and harder to beat enemies which is to be expected but to get the newest and best armor you can now get after unlocking the newest monster you can rather be grinding or give yourself a difficult time of denying that you need new armor when you clearly do the little bugs and creatures you could catch with the nets are a fun little distraction here and there plus all the different designed houses you get to see and experience for free is pleasant the amount of customization with your character your cat friend the creatures in your house and more its great the argos and the botanical research guys ngl i completely forgot if that either of their names lmao i mean the ship that sells you stuff and the place where you can plant stuff for them to supply you that stuff either way theyre super helpful and are basically needed to get a surplus of materials to craft and use against monsters plus buy things when an event happens things get an extreme price cut i used the bow and constantly had more than enough special types of arrows while spending practically nothing on them plus purchasing explosive barrels and traps to always stay supplied up overall though the game is fantastic especially for someone like myself who was blind to the upcoming monsters and saw their designs and special battles for the first time when meeting them it felt grandiose and epic when fighting giant monsters like vaal hazak and legiana for the first time with friends now battling them for fun is nice but theyre not as cool as seeing them and finding out how to slay them for the first time,True,10362,10362

76561198070400412,173839477,lets be real if youre a dual blades player in monster hunter world kushala daora is basically your nightmare incarnate for the uninitiated kushala daora is an elder dragon with that alltoofamiliar metal armor and wind manipulation sounds cool right wrong for dual blades users its a whole different story of frustration and agony first off lets talk about mobility dual blades are all about speed and relentless attacks you dash in you dash out and you keep up the pressure but kushala daora doesnt play by the rules of fair fights this dragon with its obnoxious wind shield makes landing hits an exercise in futility every time you get close it unleashes a gust that pushes you back disrupts your attacks and generally makes you feel like youre trying to dance in a hurricane those gusts arent just annoying theyre practically a slap in the face to your entire playstyle and lets not even get started on its ability to make the fight feel like its taking place in a wind tunnel youre constantly being blown away making it nearly impossible to keep up your dps the wind isnt just an inconvenience its a fullon barrier against your attacks your dual blades which are supposed to be about rapid strikes and keeping the monsters attention are rendered nearly useless because youre always being pushed out of range or staggered midcombo then theres the issue of kushala daoras frequent positioning shifts it seems like every time you get close and start laying into it it decides to fly away to a different area this is particularly grating for dual blades users who thrive on closequarters combat youre constantly chasing it down wasting time and stamina and getting more and more frustrated as it lands in a different spot and immediately starts setting up its wind shield again its a constant game of cat and mouse where youre always the mouse and its not fun the wind shield isnt just a nuisance its a fullblown disaster for your strategy if youre trying to focus on exploiting weak points or hitting specific damage zones the wind shield makes it nearly impossible youll find yourself constantly waiting for the shield to drop which it does only rarely and unpredictably and while youre waiting youre still being pushed around and thrown off your rhythm its like playing a game where the rules keep changing just to spite you kushala daoras moveset itself doesnt do dual blades players any favors either its attacks are designed to keep you at a distance which is the exact opposite of what you want as a dual blades user you need to be close to deal damage but kushala daoras attacks are constantly pushing you away or knocking you down this makes it incredibly hard to maintain the aggressive highriskhighreward playstyle that dual blades excel at instead youre stuck playing a defensive game which is the last thing you want when youre using a weapon designed for allout offense lets also not forget about the added difficulty of its status effects kushala daoras ability to inflict wind pressure which causes you to get knocked back and stagger is another layer of irritation its not just the wind shield you have to worry about its the constant interruptions that make it nearly impossible to build up your attacks or perform your signature moves its like fighting a monster thats specifically designed to ruin your day kushala daora feels like it was tailormade to make dual blades players lives miserable its a monster that counters the very essence of what dual blades stand for instead youre stuck in a constant battle against wind positioning and status effects making what should be a highenergy fight into an exhausting slog so there you have it kushala daora is without a doubt the worst monster for dual blades players in monster hunter world the wind shield the constant repositioning the disruptive attacks and the status effects all combine to create a frustrating and demoralizing experience its a fight that feels rigged against your playstyle turning what should be a thrilling hunt into a grueling test of patience and persistence,True,20555,7107

76561198173409875,173180188,it all starts when you create a character whose face only a mother could love youre then greeted by a menu system unlike any youve ever seen before it will take some time to get used to meet characters youll only interact with for the first 2 hours of gameplay before you start skipping all their dialogue but looking past these slight inconveniences your first real fight awaits you great jagras you manage to slay the beast after a fierce and somewhat buttonmashey battle only to realize that this was just the first monster out of about 70 give or take all of which will force you to interact with the game systems in new and interesting ways some will force you to target specific parts of their body to deal any meaningful damage some will inflict you with status effects which you need to counter with specific items and some more will use and even form their environment to their advantage on top of this monsters sometimes fight eachother you might be hunting one monster only to be absolutely demolished by another just running or flying right into your battle as you might guess fighting two monsters at once is difficult but the game gives you options which allow you to shoo one of them away during your adventure where you hunt these unknown monsters you will get better and better at interacting with the games systems and most importantly using your weapon this game nails the feeling of mastery like no other just like all the monster hunter games do really getting really precise parries or dodges and launching devastating counterattacks just feels so incredibly satisfying not to mention that there are several different ways to damage monsters including using the environment and several gadgets and consumables you acquire along the way to add on top of this the game features multiplayer and your actions can actually interact with your teammates hitting someone might cause them to trip depending on the weapon you can even hit someones shield to enable them to use a counterattack which then hits the monster youre hunting this isnt a system you will interact with all that much but if you want to enjoy the game to the fullest i highly advise you play some multiplayer either with randoms or preferably friends the game can get rather difficult especially once you get into the iceborne expansion its never difficult enough as to get frustrating but if youre into difficult games you can absolutely get your fill later on into the story if you just want to slap giant monsters around the game has systems in place which allow you to somewhat control difficulty with crafting certain armor pieces and weapons so you should be fine you cannot write a review of a monster hunter game without mentioning the incredible work that capcom has put into the ecology of the monsters not only are there extensive field guide entries and wiki data on how the different monsters interact with their respective ecosystems you can also see it first hand youll be able to find tracks tufts of hair mucus carcasses and much more when out on a hunt which point you towards what kind of monsters might be lurking around the game directly tells you which monster it is once youve investigated that particular monster enough but you can also see what monster it is purely based on the textures of these different tracks you find some monsters even form the environment around them to suit them this does not stop at building nests or forging paths through the forest they might incorporate toxic parts of the nature around them into their attacks they might create tunnels or burrows which allow them to use their specific modes of attack more effectively and so on this is most apparent in the rotten vale where more than half the map is formed by one specific monster as you might see i can go on and on about why this game is great dont even mention the soundtrack look up bazelgeuse theme on you tube given it has its flaws ill list a few so you dont think im too biased unorthodox and sometimes irritating menu systems especially the inventory the clutch claw an item youll be using every hunt has some trouble hitting regularly and its range is a bit weird drop rates which sometimes force you to fight the same monster more than a couple of times to actually get what you need somewhat offset by melding later in the game monster pathing can sometimes force you to run around way more than you actually want to especially when you dont know enough about a monster to be able to track it in real time tldr hunt big dinosaurs with ginormous weaponry craft comically large armor sets get bullied for your choice of weapon get bullied for your ugly armor get absolutely destroyed 100 times over by raging brachydios 910 would buy again,True,7892,7111

76561199250777574,173071257,as my entry point to the monster hunter series this was awesome and this game is quite good and stable in 2024 sure rarely a monsters ai might have a breakdown in the middle of a hunt or you get booted from your current lobby at random but other than that i think ive only ever experienced 2 or 3 bugs i managed to snag the digital deluxe edition of iceborne after receiving a gift card for steam and was kind of skeptical at first i was looking for a game that had slow deep and methodical combat as i wanted to take a break from more fast paced combat and after some troubles understanding the system at first cause i chose charge blade as starter weapon boy did it deliver you really feel every big hit especially a weapons ultimate move like tcs helmbreaker they should really rename this tailsplitter to point out where longsword players are supposed to aim wyvernfire saed zsd or doing the golf swing and knocking out the monster on hammer also landing counters is really satisfying especially when you learn a monsters entire moveset and know how to react to each one of them another thing that might go overlooked is the deep ecology of the monsters they dont just have abilities for the heck of it there is an ecological reason as to why a monster has a certain ability and the turf wars are great when theyre unique at least cough cough and flying wyvern in iceborne cough cough i know this game is considered easier than past entries in the series but i dont think players can deny that some of the game play changes have made hunting more enjoyable except for the clutch claw that thing is broken and im glad its not making a return in wilds probably my biggest beef for this title though would be if youre looking to progress through the story of this game with a friend then have fun watching cutscenes twice i dont know why capcom decided that thats the method for determining what type of hunts players can do together but they did poor decision on that front oh and also i wonder if the next handler will not be an idiot who favorite saying is when in doubt take a bite finally for any prospect player this game is very much a you might not like it at the start but just hold out itll click eventually and also its not for everyone but the people it is for welcome to the point of no return you can kiss 100s maybe even 1000 hours bye bye cause thats what this series does to you hyped for wilds,True,6062,5783

76561198013028771,173066118,tldr bit starts slightly slow and rough but grows on you offers a semirelaxed to intense boss fight kind of experience with decent variety and a very alive feeling ecosphereb editedupdated with more player experience trying mhw for the 1st time having played dauntless with friends several years ago 1st impression bmhw combat is rough ps1era rough but it does improveb weapon aim is badterrible slightly over direction locked but no real target lock in the training area i tried every single starter weapon struggled to hit a barrel in front of me bthis improves significantly in actual gameplay your targets are very largeb i started with sword and shield thinking initially the mobility dodge would feel most familiar and ppl recommend it but it was the opposite it was a constant reminder of the bad aspects of the games combat how much it doesnt feel like most crisp hacknslashers b before i watched a video and changed how i played tt felt more like monstermoshpit than combatb even with that poor beginner combat experience and a very slow start before it opens up and lets to do stuff the hunting the way world feels very alive and exploration matters the chasing down the hunt quickly grows to a fun experience that keeps building you end playing for longer than you should and having watched how to combat video i switched to the incredibly mobile insect glaive had a significantly better combat experience hint you arent meant to be in a boxing match with a trex and you need to know a few higher damage combos for your weapon the world definitely feels more serious feels like it looks better even if its ps3 era graphics on steroids bdauntless from several years ago has fluid crisp visceral combatb you did something you failed to dodge ouch you got too greedy with attacks ignoring warning signs wham you score a heavy hit breaking a part explosion monster crumples for a bit everyone dog piles to lay down damage with impunity you need to blow that part off to get the material you need teamwork and clutch saving each other galore its very engaging its the codmw of the monster hunting genre but dauntless levels just start to feel like arenas and the game gets a bit sameie after a while graphics wise its cartoonish the monsters are great but all the locations feel like arenas albeit shaped arenas but not a world multiple weapon types were very satisfying to me and definitely cater to different play styles different bosses encouraged having a few favorites there wasnt the ability to carry 2 weapons back then honestly the only bad weapon was guns because the playstyle was boring in comparison i see myself flat out not liking several of the monster hunter weapons it definitely changes how you play vs traditional hacknslashes and that very much changes how you expect weapons to behave they do a few cool things different kinds of mounting monsters cutting and bashing parts off etc glaives when you mount a monster can cartwheel damage overall they are decent but none of them feel as dramatic as dauntless perhaps they gain a little back for feeling more earned but overall just less feedback in combat in dauntless one of my favorite things was building up a full lance charge blast then waiting for the owlbear to try to do its flying swoop timing dont miss nailed it boom the owlbear is stunned midflight instead of swooping it slams face 1st into the ground tearing up a furrow like a crashing shuttle dog pile you feel great for the team and get instant visceral feedback for your actions bmhw will never give that intense a momentb it will never have that clutch team save or feel as engaging in combat as dauntless in its good moments bbut it offers an experience that is overall a more stable fun and is a far less stressful gameb because its experience is not just arena after arena i expect the average person will have far less burnout than dauntless too you can kinda choose to wander around doing things casual or aggressively go after fights even go after fights that will push you mhw delivers shocking moments like monsters that actually have behaviors and habits a great mh moment is when you are fighting a rock behemoth that you are wondering if you will quite manage to beat on your own but then a giant fishsnake happens to wander by a giant fishsnake that as a species shares a mutual hatred with rock behemoths due to territorial disputes so unlike some other beasts that could have wondered by they immediately ignore you to go all in on each other giant fishsnake suddenly wraps around the rock beasts body several times and starts deathrolling it after a quick monster piece ripping bout the fish runs off leaving a limping rock beast ready for you to finish off another good moment fighting a chimeralike birdsnake slowly but steadily beating it rex thumps its way up hurts it a bit and the birdsnake runs off ok ill try fighting a rex chomp oh that was 13 of my health run run run hide hide hide now i sneak my way back the to bird snake but i have to take a couple detours because that rex just happens to be perusing right where i need to cross i wont spoil some of the 1st encounter moments but they are great i reviewed solo should you get this to play with a friend yes youll enjoy that but i wish they didnt have the cutscene restriction it wont feel like a coop campaign like most games its going to feel more like an open world game but playing with people is nice they also have a flare system that invites random players you can set restrictions so that helps in tough fights or you can join others flares plus you can host or join a townhub instance that other players can be in anyone there can see when someone posts a mission and join or do their own thing as they please you will be back and forth between your own thing and joining more in this than other games where you would stay in someones fireteam,True,3737,3666

76561198357356001,172887884,i rly wanted to like this game but tbh i just couldnt sadly its a good game dont get me wrong but there are just alot of annoyances that while small when added together just ruin the game for me i think the main thing is just how clunky everything feels like in order to enter combat you have to press the attack button then start attacking simple right the problem is that when youre in the attack mode you cant sprint or use items lets say youre low on health and need to use a healing potion you have to sheith your weapon which depending on your chosen weapon can take a short or long amount of time select your healing potion using either a radial menu or scrolling through all your items till you select the healing potion then you need to press the use key in order to start drinking the potion but it doesnt instantly heal you bur instead plays a long animation while it heals you to the specified amount bearing in mind that if this animation gets interrupted by any means your healing will be cut off and youll have to drink another potion on paper this doesnt sound too bad but keep in mind the game doesnt pause while your doing this meaning you have to do all this whilst also being damaged and knocked around by the monster your hunting bear in mind you also have to go through a similar process to keep your weapon sharpness up as well as when trapping monster and it gets frustrating fast but whats more frustrating is the fact that monsters will flee like to the other side of the map when your trying to hunt them and the fact that they can also de spawn when ever they feel like it and its just not that fun especially seen as how some of these monsters seem to have huge amounts of health and if they get too far away from you you have to sheith your weapon run up to them and un sheith your weapon and then keep attacking that is unless they dont stun lock you and then kill you first another thing that makes the combat painful is the lock on system instead of your character tracking the monster its just your camera that tracks it meaning you have to manually adjust where your character is facing in order to get some hits in the issue with this is that you have to commit to every attack you do meaning that if the monster moves whilst youre performing a combo youll be stuck there swinging at nothing until you have to reajust your position or the monster knocks you down with an attack i really wanted to like this game its got a good story great gameplay loop of hunting monsters to get material to upgrade your gear and the environments and monsters are all gorgeously well designed its just that the controlls and mechanics feel clunky and slow whereas the gameplay feels like it wants you to be fast paced and quick which to me just doesnt feel possible with the mechanics and controls which is a bumper cos ive always like the idea of the monster hunter games,False,349,349

76561198824066579,172872909,very fun but a bit of a tutorial hell at the beginning there is an element of exploration to some degree but dont expect it to be akin to breath of the wild or the likes the exploration is much less interesting if you like fighting big monsters and boss battles then this might be the game for you but beware if you expect it to feel like easier dark souls like i did the combat is quite different from soulslike games there is indeed rolling etc and utilizing different moves of different weapons however there is a lot of emphasis on combos you cannot do every move right out of the box in many cases you need to perform a certain move so that you can do a different move the second can be done only in a sequence with the first whereas in soulslikes generally you can perform most moves as standalones this makes the combat in monster hunter a little more about your own moves a little less about the boss moves imo also the fact that you need to combo moves made me feel like i had a bit less agency in the game vs soulslike games it also can get grindy but it is definitely not required at least not at the point in game where i did get performing repeatable quests to get certain items required to craft better weaponsarmor just feels nice in this game,True,5799,3747

76561198066356635,172475776,this game is like crack cocaine while it can be overwhelming for new players at the start once you get into it it is incredibly addictive though i struggle to decide on whether its because the game is actually any good or not or if the core gameplay loop is just that addictive the concept of fighting giant monsters that give you access to materials that you can use to craft better gear that in turn lets you hunt bigger monsters is just an incredibly solid foundation for an addictive game on top of that the game has some incredible charm whether it be the ridiculously sized weapons you use or the cat companions that help you out the game does however have some major flaws that i hope gets addressed in the upcoming sequel for one coop is a bit disappointing especially since the functionality for it is built into the game and works completely fine for side content and the game is a lot of fun to play with friends which is why its so baffling that for some reason it doesnt extend to the main story of the game it is practically impossible to play through the main story missions together with a friend one of you has to have already completed the quest to be able to join it and even then you can only join the very end of the quest since you cant join before all of the cutscenes have played for some reason i genuinely dont understand why they have made it this way since coop works just fine when playing side content why not allow people to play the main story missions together as well additionally the combat has some flaws its made up for by sheer cool factor the weapons are all incredibly unique and the monster audiovisual designs are great that being said the longer you play the more frustrating the sluggish feel of the combat can get this isnt due to poor performance or optimisation the game runs smoothly and the hitboxes are spot on but there are several design decisions that can make the game unnecessarily frustrating for example there is no animation cancelling which is odd since the combat is based around combos practically every third person action game that has its combat revolving around combos have animation cancelling whats worse is that there isnt any direction cancelling either if you attack in a certain direction the rest of you attacks in that attack string will go in the exact same direction unless you stop attacking move your character and then attack again this cant even be solved by dodging if you attack to the left dodge forwards and attack again the second attack will go to the left unless you stop after dodging and move forwards additionally i was left dumbfounded when i read the description of an item piece that said that it prolonged invincibility frames while dodging and i went oh theres iframes in this game before reading that item description if someone had pointed a gun to my head and asked are there iframes in mh world i would have looked them in the eye and without a seconds doubt said no there are no iframes in mh world apparently there is though you will likely never notice it while playing i have no idea how slim the dodge window is but it must be incredibly small noticeably smaller than games like dark souls and elden ring i genuinely thought it was a stylistic choice to make you have to dodge based on direction rather than based on timing overall the game is worth whatever it costs on any given day especially if its on sale its great not bad in any way just frustrating why is the coop designed the way it is and why is the combat so sluggish hopefully these issues while be addressed in the upcoming sequel,True,6439,2059

76561198039514221,172430999,im writing this review from the eyes of someone with little prior experience in the monster hunter series who came into the title late and with limited friends to coop with on my first playthrough i mostly solod the game as if it was a purely single player experience though i took advantage of the sos system from time to time i would later play it again with my fiancee and daughter who are both hooked overall score 910 gameplay 910 takes some learning but the game is fairly generous with the difficulty curve until a certain boss skill checks you hard a couple of hours in a necessary and not particularly difficult fight if you actually dodge if youve ever played a souls like game youll be at home with the basic play style your goal is to kill the thing before it kills you every attack can be dodged and learning enemy patterns and weaknesses is pretty important it is no where near as difficult as a souls game but it is every bit as complex every weapon type has a completely different playstyle and takes hours of game play to master i mostly played insect glaive and bow weapon and armor sets are pretty varied and the stat system is easy enough to understand most of what youll be doing is accepting missionsquests then going out into the world to hunt the thing which may or may not be 25 feet tall and breath fire the rest of the time will be spent crafting items gathering resources and building a gear set for the boss you want to fight story 810 you are a member of the last wave of reinforcements to a newly discovered continent in the monster hunter universe allowing for the game to be a sort of soft reboot of the series the story has a heavy emphasis on exploring and studying this country while defending your fledgling civilization from the big bad killing machines from establishing camps and hunting dangerous creatures to finding missing people and trying to solve the overarching mystery of the giant walking volcano the story takes you across a wide variety of environments and settings with characters that are interesting enough most npcs exist to give you your missions and react to events your character steadily goes from the new guy with a knife to world saving hero who looks at the living incarnation of pure elemental power and tells his friends to leave because he got this the story does a good job of switching the pace up to keep you interested and throws a few curveballs at you just when you think youre almost done the game just starts to take off worldlevel design 1010 the games environments are absolutely beautiful and incredibly complex the forest clearing you start in is actually far bigger than you initially realize as later missions will bring you back here to explore more of it you will probably believe that is is around a 3rd of the size it actually is at first ranging from ground level beaches and woods to exploring the tallest treetops other zones are equally impressive unless you intentionally go back and start exploring everything the level design seems to do a good job at keeping you from accidentally wandering into places you arent ready for but they are completely accessible from the start so good luck if you want to slay a rathian with your starter weapon and leather armor at least it has fire resistance other areas include a mountain top filled with coral that resembles a seafloor a death and disease ridden cavern so on each is worth taking the time to explore not only for the aesthetic but also for the various resources the you can find a new addition to the mh series in this one is expeditions which essentially allow you to wander around any of the areas without any restrictions on time or kos this allows you to safely explore the areas and fight anything that spawns there gathering resources or practicing boss mechanics i was thoroughly impressed by the size and detail given to the various areas contentgameplay hours 1010 people have thousands of hours in this game for good reason the main story will take you anywhere from 3560 hours depending on how much grinding and side quests you do the end game super bosses are numerous and fun granting endless potential the community is still very active so finding people online for the hunts this is the part where soloing starts to become very difficult is pretty quick due how different the play styles for each weapon is you can start a new save file and play again with a completely different control scheme there really isnt an end to this games potential,True,6260,5707

76561198023490380,172344926,i played monster hunter world on the console for well over 400 hours and while i enjoy the game im not really big in the slaying monsters aspect im more of a tranquilize them person and feel really bad when i accidentally kill them which is a reason i hate fighting elder dragons that said since you can capture most monsters in this game i do appreciate that and this game is definitely credited for bringing monster hunter to the mainstream this game is really fun with complex weapon systems and hardcore gameplay each fight with the monsters feeling like they could be souls boss i wasnt a big fan of iceborne to be honest and never finished it on console but the base game i always enjoyed im personally getting too old to enjoy these games much anymore i cant really handle the stress of hunting for 40 minutes only to lose and i find difficult punishing games to not really be that enjoyable much anymore but i bought this on pc to experiment with mods and i have to say theres some really fun ones it almost feels like skyrim in its modability and i discovered some that actually allows me to enjoy my favorite part of this series walking around the beautiful environments and just watching and studying the monsters no worrying about going out and fighting them so for the 400 hours i enjoyed of this on console and for the modability of this version allowing me to play it in a pacifist sense it definitely gets a positive from me,True,1197,70

76561199542776685,172305712,monster hunter world is a strong contender for my favourite game of all time stunning graphics although perhaps not quite aaa standard exciting gameplay with incredible depth and essentially infinite replayability all work hand in hand for this game to claim that honour admittedly the game is also one of the hardest games to get into that ive ever played the first dozen or couple dozen depending on how much you take your time hours span the worst tutorial that ive ever seen in a game starting missions that are a diabolical juxtaposition of too handholdy extensive tooltips and introductions while not necessarily telling you everything you want to know all that to say this game essentially tells you that you have a skill issue and that you need to suck it up and learn the weapon youre using learn the monster youre fighting and figure out the item hotbar that at first seems like a curse from the devs but actually ends up being quite intuitive once you figure the damn thing out and of course the game is intentionally grindy its the gameplay loop so if you arent ready for that it might not be for you however the grind is generally good fun along with that the story is mediocre at best although who cares that much were here to fight monsters and the dialogue is painful with a certain ever present character as a glaring example of this the unskippable cutscenes are annoying at best and agonizing at worst especially when youve played through the game several times and the way the multiplayer is handled needs a serious overhaul as being unable to play through story missions with friends that you or they havent completed yet makes it a pain to coordinate and ruins the potential to experience monsters for the first time with another newbie friend all of those may sound like glaring flaws but there is a silver lining and boy oh boy is it a rich vein of silver the combat is fluid and diverse each weapon offering a unique playstyle and ensuring that there is almost certainly something for everyone want to take down a fire breathing trex with a hammer to the skull bonk away brother vanquish an ice wyvern with the overthetop combination of sword shield and axe that is the charge blade charge those phials and take it down literally slay the god of all dragons with mhws take on a minigun this game has you covered there are many many monsters to take on and the content is almost doubled and far improved in most cases with the iceborne dlc which i recommend getting in a bundle with the base game the ecosystems feel almost alive and although certain maps may make you feel lost the level of immersion that this game achieves with the living world capcom created is incredible and the food looks scrumptious the fights are action packed and adrenaline inducing there is no better feeling that i have found in a video game to date than finally mastering the tough fight that you spent so long getting kicked to the curb in maybe you land the ko combo youve been practicing maybe you perfect parry the monsters signature move and maybe you just tank the dang thing and laugh in its panting face while you heft your greatsword for the killing blow one thing is certain nothing can stop you now this game is easily worth full price despite being years old at this point but you can grab it on heavy discount quite a lot of the time if you are to grab the bundle on sale iceborne is one of the best dlcs i have experienced despite some flaws i have simply sat down in the seliana gathering hub hot spring and stared out at the gleaming sea for hours no other game has managed to have quite the same effect give the game a shot if you are willing to put in the time for the grind ahead buy it on sale if you arent sure it is at least worth a try go through at least until beating anjanath at that point the tutorial is more or less over and the hunts start to pick up the pace and please dont use the guardian armorweapons as they will seriously ruin the fun of the game you are supposed to lose supposed to learn and grind to improve not use heavily boosted gear meant to speed experienced players through to the dlc unless a boring base game is your goal avoid guardian gear like the plague if you made it all the way through my ted talk thanks for taking the time to read it i dont write reviews on games and generally dont spend as much time gaming as i used to however monster hunter is one game that has stuck with me and i cant wait to see what the future has in store with wilds alright having said all that im heading back to the new world someone has been stealing my collection of teostra foreskins that i hang on my mantelpiece as trophies and i intend to replenish my stock posthaste until we meet in the field hunter may your blade stay sharp and the canteen never run out of purrotein,True,7503,6521

76561199162403133,172287489,compared to its previous titles worlds is fairly adapted to a wider audience i have been playing these games since i was 10 but i hold no bias drm bothers me because it affects my system performance very drastically the game is a grind and requires a depth of understanding of skills decorations monsters and everything else that is flung to you overtime obviously you do not have to play this way but there is a major difference in positive and negative opinion when you have all the correct gear know what you are doing and are having fun this is quite possibly what turns most people away and i have heard a faint amount of people regard the gameplay as soulslike preparation is key and i denounce the term get gud because this game requires more than basic skill weapon choice doesnt matter to those around you just find what flows with you best and practice the menu layouts and ui for worlds have always been a small nuisance to me i prefer the layout and general navigation of menus in rise and i also receive a variety of connection issues across all platforms yes i own the game on 3 platforms there is a debate among tenderizing and unfortunately a lack of understanding about this one mechanic out of a plethora can lead to harder longer hunts regardless the game is fun and good with friends i havent met any toxic hunters either if you can overcome the overwhelming flow of mechanics and gameplay options i believe you will enjoy this game ps remember to eat,True,9927,360

76561198077111729,172185773,i really want to give this game a thumbs up ive sadly been spoiled with previous generation monster hunter games and this one is just not it the difficulty is too easy for me it took 20 hours to cart the first time due to my controller dying i actually never carted once in the base game it wasnt until iceborne launched that i actually started to cart frequently on hunts high rank armor being insufficient in master rank quests is indeed true for world even the most basic of mr sets can satisfy your defenses until elder dragons show up world itself is an introduction to the west prior games required you to set up a japanese account on the nintendo shop and either use your phones translate option or through developing muscle memory to navigate the menus ive got about 2500 hours in mhxx fortunately that game did come to the west as mhgu man oh man it is mhgus fault that my experience with world was so lack luster you may look at my 100 hours and say well thats quite a lot of time for the investment of money while this may be true there is a 15 dollar game on the nintendo e shop that will give you 2000 hours of playtime and that wont unlock everything or even half of everything worlds content was complete in about 30 hours iceborne added about 50 hours to that end game grinding is just not fun when the only real challenge is hoping you get good rng for that deco you want i think world undersold what monster hunter is the qol changes may be welcome now but in the future when they become common place and the community still cries its too hard it will only continue to be made easier and easier monster hunters core gameplay loop is what is so much fun start with basic gear kill a monster use its drops to build better gear kill a stronger monster etc its fun having to master a monster to learn what movers can it do at what distance and what you can do to play around those timings when the monster is so easy that you dont need to learn these timings the fun goes out the window hitting something brainlessly with no real strategy or reason is boring i wish there was a middle road for a review score the game looks great runs great has cool armors and weapons and the monsters interact with each other and the environment the difficulty is just not there for me and i fear it will only get easier as time goes on they are already showing off gameplay of the new mh wilds you can turn your character to aim your weapon like a great sword this makes using great sword much easier and in turn lowers the skill cap immensely its taking a lot of the fun of mastering a weapon and more importantly as previously stated mastering the monster youre hunting i cant think of a single monster i mastered in world it was simply 1015 minute fights all the way up to safi jiva and the end game edlers looking back in mhxxmhgu which i havent played since 2019 i can still remember mastering dreadqueen and dreadking rath formulating your set and load out actually mattered and a single mistake proved fatal on the higher tiers of quests you had to know the mechanics timings and the ins and outs of your weapons and arts if you were to stand a chance against these end game monsters in world you just hit it till it dies,False,6342,6272

76561198053298401,172135538,i was very much hard on this game at release frankly its better than i had given it credit but it is still one of my least favorite mh titles the biggest complaints i have are 1 how terribly cluttered every single zone is with foliage camera is frequently covered and makes getting blindsided by attacks a frequent occurrence especially in the ancient forest this also ties into how obscured hidden passages are because of lack of distinction from regular background details 2 how many special animations there are in this game youre frequently teetering around like a toddler because the ground is too sloped stumbling up ledges where you cant dodge slowly recovering from attacks jumping off ledges and slowly climbing massive walls of vines this worked in 4 ultimate or generationsultimate where this was used much more sparsely but it struggles to keep up with the sheer amount of interactions in worlds environment brings 3 dazed status is a nightmare in this game in past titles the status was quickly taken care of by jiggling the thumbstick to shake it off but because of the cheek slap animation youre spending almost double time just getting back to control your character i get the idea of making use of decos to nullify this effect but this is massive overkill 4 theres so many cutscenes where youre forced to slowly walk from area to area i could not imagine playing this a second time with how badly the game demands you pay attention to what it wants to show you not only that but it takes so much time to get from point a to point b where youre just forced to hold forward and listen its very much a modern day angle for game making that capcom is shifting toward in the most painful of ways all in all this game has grown on me i still feel like the new monster designs are weak and lacking when sized up next to the originals and the naming conventions they went with are just poor in a way that almost doesnt feel like mionster hunter names i would give this game a 510 but in terms of a thumbs up or down system i could only do a down if youre looking for a better offering the base game of monster hunter rise is vastly superior in all aspects but the sunbreak expansion drags it down nearly to the level of world,False,6908,5216

76561198321432179,171939620,advise for new player that are planning to play this game you wont regret reading this 1 if you planning to actually dive deep and enjoy this game to its finest do not use the defender gears and weapons use the actual monsters armors and weapons since that is prty much the true big part of the game making powerful gears and managing the skills to hunt stronger monsters if u just wanna go fast straight to dlc tho well i guess just use the defender gears fyi defender gears gave u the high stats and dmg that prty much scales up way too far for the base game so yea ur prty much accelerating the base game story progress way to quick if u use this equipment bcz of how strong it is which is reasonable for reaching iceborne quicker 2 try to enjoy the game first i know the fainting and grinding for gears can be prty tiring but trust me its very rewarding and the constant hunting and re hunting the same monsters is indeed the fun part of the game i remember back in base game i kill 20 black diablos in a day with charge blade just for its rare twisted horn drop and only got like 4 lmao there are 14 weapon types in mhw all with different playstyle and moves from melee to ranged so pick a weapon try it on the training ground and see which one do u like more that fit ur style and gameplay 3 buy the iceborne dlc since 50 of the full content of the game is locked in there i know 2x such a boomer right but the same goes to mh rise too and mh have always been like this with extra content but i assure you its very worth it to get the dlc more monsters new stronger weapons and gears more equipments more weapon moveset and skills and finally ofcourse the endgame content i especially really recommend to get this on discount 4 if u wanna play good and actually learn the game do not sos until you hit a wall on the monsters hunt and it became frustrating to you back in base game i dont even know online session existed lol but yea i used to count atleast 10x failed hunt 1st until i finally decide to sos so try to the learn the mechanic the weapons the monsters move and all the aspect of the game this is proly my biggest advice for you learn to huntfight cuz if u keep sos ing ur way to iceborne and to endgame ur prty much going to struggle bcz ur lackness of ability to survive a hunt and fighting and most importantly you will likely immediately dropping the game bcz u dont get the true experience of hunting in monster hunter cuz people keep doing it for you especially if you are the type of person who easily get bored and drop games quickly 5 dont be afraid to join an online session you can ask for advice and help to the people there on online sessions no worry mhw community is very friendly and most of the time we always help each other neither its learning a weapon skills hunting or even progressing ur quest also dont be afraid to diefaint on a hunt bcz most 999 like me or even any veteran hunters will understand and wont be mad and scold you d if u wanna try to enjoy the game and actually learn i can also help you to tell the way hit me up if u wanna hunt together 6 this is for items management grab any materials you see in the map this is very important for starters because you gonna need a lot of stuff if u wanna make some useful items like healing buff potion traps flash pod and even for some armors and weapons so pay attention to the materials and see what u need for crafting cuz lots of it will still be useful till endgame oh yea also try to understand what items do to you cuz some of it will highly beneficial to you and the weapon ur using like dash juice is very good for stamina related weapons for example 7 lastly just enjoy the flow of the game no need to hasten everything mhw progression is supposed to be slow so its fine to take some times hunting lots of monsters understanding the game and strengthening your gears so just do ur hunt learn the weapons understand the mechanic and continue the story theres more that i can say for new players tbh but i think this 7 point is probably some of the important stuff that i can say to you so yeah see you in hunt hunters,True,232701,206279

76561198229279756,171839705,the first time i picked this game up i didnt really get it combat felt slow my character felt way too weak and i couldnt understand how the games systems like armor skills food bufs etc linked together however picking it up again and taking the time to read up on things i didnt get and just experiment i cant put this game down the cycle of gathering hunting crafting is super satisfying and seeing yourself progress to larger and more difficult monsters gives a sense of accomplishment on the same scale as a game like dark souls with there being no xp or skill trees you know for sure that when you take down a monster its down to the choices you made on what items armor food and weapon to use as well as your own skills after getting into this series i even found myself picking up an older game in the series mh4u on 3ds just so i can scratch the monster hunter itch on the go trust me when this game clicks and you get it its absolutely fantastic,True,3531,1559

76561199019468016,171816392,monster hunter has been a staple for me for many years and this one is no exception you have hours of fun stuff to do and many hours you can spend with your friends and show them how to hunt them monsters my only one gripe is the sheer amount of new people who play this game using the defender gear it is given to you but i encourage new players to not even look at it as it makes the start of the game where youre supposed to be learning the games mechanics and how to read and counter monsters that much more challenging later on when they reach high and master rank as they have no idea how to read skills or learn monsters weaknesses,True,16261,13612
76561199465900495,171814404,its really fun,True,478,478
76561198078746306,171813521,i feel like this one of the only rpgs i enjoy no leveling stats to worry about screwing up only gear materials combat feels somewhat like dark souls in that getting hit tends to hurt a lot attacking at the wrong time gets you hit and memorizing when and how to dodge are how you stay alive also atrocious hitboxes all around thats pretty much where the similarities end every weapon plays drastically differently so give them all a chance to see what clicks with you this game feels like it was designed around coop usually youll want 4 players including yourself there are still some active lobbies at the time of writing but i still recommend bringing your own friends if possible higher level gear can annihilate low rank mobs at lightning fast speeds and many players have had the time to get past the entirety of master rank and the special bosses added after this has also given rise to one of my favorite pastimes which is seeing how quickly my friends and i can delete the great jagras at the beginning of the game you likely wont need to pay attention to much beyond the armor level of your gear in low rank hunts but later on youll need to set up a proper build to maximize your damage and your life youll likely be swapping armor somewhat often as you progress through the game and less so when you hit the end of high rank then repeating the process again through master rank i dont really play souls games so this is one of the harder games i like playing some of it will feel unfair sometimes youll get stunned or oneshot or hit by something that should have missed by a mile but its doable and not just by souls junkies take a break bring a friend and run it again unlike souls games youve got nothing to lose except the time you spent hunting that specific monster youre not punished for taking the time to learn here you dont need to retrace your steps for half an hour or worry about losing any money also you can get layered armor to run separate gear for cosmetics and stats if you wanna play fashion hunter but thats endgame stuff happy hunting,True,17769,17583
76561198019966189,171810247,not for me thats my final verdict for a game title to have the word world in it i thought i was going to be dropped into an open world environment where i can free roam and explore and kill monsters nope this anime game is just a linear pipe run where you go from quest to quest quest hunt or capture monster or gather items youre dropped in a very limited environment each time to hunt one monster that you run into easily within one minute as its footprints are right outside your base then you spend the next 10 just chipping away its health thats not even visible everyone claims its the hunt and preparation thats the goal of the game but thats just lazy this game is dull its incredibly repetitive it has a poor ui the graphics are a bit blurry the combat is clunky you have way too many tutorials with walls of text because the game developers didnt bother to create a story that introduces you to the mechanics of the game i just cant get into this some will say how brilliant japanese people are at creating these types of games but i just say its lazy the environment is so boring that i cant enjoy it i will recommend this game simply because it works well there are no bugs the mechanisms even though clunky work well but if youve played and enjoyed free roam games like witcher 3 skyrim elden ring fallout grand theft auto etc you will not enjoy this game,True,982,768

76561198095885624,171737256,playing monster hunter world after monster hunter rise is a mistake monster hunter world is no doubt a good game but my personal enjoyment has been an disappointment the wirebug mechanic from rise felt superior in every way compared to the slinger mechanic in world while the slinger mechanic felt like a chore to use and invasive to my gameplay i could not imagine playing world any longer given that i do not enjoy a core mechanic within the game,False,1704,1584

76561198012044752,171727184,hard to say after only an hour but with the bad lip sync if they are even speaking english and the cutesy pet and the dramatically stupid intro it clearly has asian influence its also lacking significant voice over to cover the text often dont even correspond so no idea if thats a translation issue or they just cant be bothered having the english voice actors completing all the story board not a big deal but it certainly sets the stage for a low quality implementation for the english audience,True,219,58
76561198035132906,171722421,i do recommend the game if you think you may like it if not maybe you are on the fence thinking the lootgrinding isnt for you just know that there are enough ways around that so you can still enjoy the game because the core of the experience is still hunting monsters and practically speaking you should actually be able to experience hunting almost every single one without farming much at all now its clear that hunting for gear is supposed to be quite a big source of depth for the game but as i said it was not as necessary as i thought to the point where i actually felt kind of let down with the fact that it actually didnt make much sense for me to engage with it during the story so that is my one big criticism that there were so many stylish weapons and armour pieces available and yet i beat the final boss with such boring crap as the bone armour set and a kuluyaku hammer because they were actually perfectly good gear even compared to what i would have crafted from killing elder dragons for 10 hours straight still loved the game loved hitting the monsters and how they would react to your attacks get caught in traps have turf wars etc its like no other action game for sure and definitely worth playing even the base game even if you only play the story,True,2412,2412

76561197977241317,171569855,i uh i played a while 10 hours then i got frustrated and left it alone for a while but you know how skill based games work you eventually come back with a new mindset before my break i had stubbornly stuck to great sword one of the fourteen playstyle options for weapons because i never really tried using anything else i kept seeing my methods not work over and over i had hit a major wall in both progression and enthusiasm then i realized my mistake i hadnt even touched any of the other 13 options so i came back with the idea of just trying out the other options after going through most of the melee options i landed on charge blade it was mobile had both fast weak and slow strong attack options could block and was just complex enough to make every fight interesting before i knew it i sank another 60 hours in and had beaten the base game solo with charge blade before we go further i want to say that all the weapons are fun and none are necessarily better than others i certainly have my preferences but thats not to say i dislike the other options i believe that every hunter should spend at least 15 minutes messing around with each weapon to try them all out even multiple times throughout progression because attitudes can change the iceborne expansion is a must not for the clutch claw that everyone seems to have mixed feelings about its the changes to weapon movesets that makes midcombo transitions flawless its for the new monsters and difficulty that werent there in base game its for the completely customizable room that you can get ptsdd from because you can set the ambience music to the theme of your most painful monster fight its for the grammeowster chef who makes the best food ever to be found in a video game its for the new armor and weapon designs that look either truly ridiculous or insanely awesome i beat the entire expansion twice putting in 300 hours grinding gear and powering through tough fights when i beat the expansion the first time i went into the post game content by myself and spent another 400 hours getting the high level gear and learning movesets screw metas have fun with your journey i grinded the same fight for 30 hours after learning how it worked just to flex on the ai monster i did that for all the endgame fights the amount of time you can put into the game with one weapon and then realize you know nothing about the other options is insane the entire game is a learning experience learn the basic mechanics first then learn the weapons then pick one and master it then learn the monsters the learning curve is steep at first i wont deny that the moment of realization where you learn how everything clicks together in a fight thats what you play for this game is an investment of time sure but thats how all games work you put in time you get enjoyment out of it its your choice what you invest in ive chosen to invest in this one because i like it tldr slow start but with time it turns into really fun challenges do recommend expansion but try base game first start of high rank is what i would call a good time to pick to get it it can genuinely be difficult to get into but worth it,True,73205,64103

76561199304818486,171519829,its a masterpiece that still holds up after six years if you want a game that teaches you its mechanics in a way that feels fulfilling and has minimal bs i highly recommend this game the same goes for the dlc if you love the base game iceborne is that but cranked up to 11 however this is a challenging game you will see a difficulty bump once you get to iceborne and like most monster hunter games it expects you to have been playing in the moment what i mean by that is that mhw is known for its title updates a few monsters and events would be dropped then culminating in the endgame updates you would have been playing on and off at that time however nearly everything including the endgame fights is unlocked immediately after you beat shara that includes 4 of the most brutal fights in the gameraging furious alatreon and fatalis the game expects you to have been playing for a while before even dropping into those fights and playing a certaingrinding here comes the main problem with iceborne the guiding lands oh my god he said the thing the grinding lands is a boring tedious repetitive way to make you extremely powerful it was so powerful that to make those fights not look like a joke capcom made them some of the hardest fights in the series its not the game the series however those fights are extremely satisfying once you get to the level where you wont lose 72 of your health on a single hit it just shows that capcom didnt think about balancing the endgame well fatalis was an excellent and challenging final boss but he was a great sendoff to the game patreon needs a rework not with the fight but instead about the inner workings it sucks that if you are a cb user your main damagedealing attack your literal bread and butter does nothing the game doesnt show which weapons work best and the fight was good the foundation it was built around was terrible for those who arent in the know the elemental building in this game is horrible a lot of slots are needed for very little return thats why you should use the defender set or any blast weapon you will be carried until you fight patreon i cannot blame the player base because we still need to get a say in making blast meta it just turned out that way however capcoms remedy for this is making some fights completely easy if you have a particular element that is a fun fact if you usually play you can only beat alatreon with a fire ice or dragon element weapon that is what rubs me the wrong way alatreon is to most people the 2nd most brutal fight in the game and he limits what monster hunter is all about which is build crafting the next step after him is the final boss of the game i get what capcom was trying to do and honestly i love the idea of suppressing eschaton judgment god such a good mechanic i wish that other elements did something or better yet worked the different aspects into the fight have thunder and water stagger alatreon more and not prevent eschaton but instead extend the time till that would make it a modernday behemoth and maybe a start to introducing more raid mechanics into mh fire and ice prevent it from killing you the dragon can break the horns to prevent it from changing elements and water and thunder stagger and extend your invisible timer it was a good fight but the end game ultimately made the buildup to the battle unbearable tldr this game is worth its weight in gold but the endgame kinda sours the experience not too much to become unbearable but just enough that it is noticeable thank god capcom fixed it in rise 1010 i would hunt again highly recommend it,True,11335,11334

76561198071695751,171268673,while monster hunter world is decent fun for several hours it becomes overly repetitive before reaching endgame combat is not as polished and fluid as it could be leading to sometimes frustrating and slow hunts gathering crafting items and micromanaging different gameplay systems to maximize buffs and rewards is extremely tedious the story is bland and not much to speak of the real enjoyment in this game comes from executing wellplanned hunts and learning to fight new monsters unfortunately lack of variety causes the spark to be lost before the game really gets going overall 510,False,5226,5226

76561198884262086,171072595,h3 tldr one of my favorite games of all time for now strongly recommend h3 being my first proper introduction to monster hunter played freedom unite in the psp for like 5 minutes years ago i recommend playing this game to whoever may read this coming from games like elden ringdark souls and then playing this its somewhat difficult to adjust in the beginning of the game with the lockon system and its controls as i further played the game i preferred simply not locking on due to possible camera shenanigans the game didnt fully hook me in initially as i feel somewhat overwhelmed with the amount of systems tutorials and mechanics that popups from the game really didnt help me that much however playing the game naturally makes you familiar with this mechanics though i do admit that when i mained the longsword i didnt really use the counter mechanics ie foresight slash and iai spirit slash so i was basically using the longsword like it was pre 5th gen monster hunter until rajang which im surprised i made it that far what really hooked me in at first was defeating my first rathalos and diablos sturggling from them and defeating them as those were the first monsters that really took some time for me to defeat made the game click for me the iceborne dlc is what really made me invested as barioth was my first real wall in the game as i change my build and took me 2 attempts and more than 30 minutes to beat however my second wall was rajang postdlc story which really tested my skill and made me take a break in the game and reevaluate how i use the longsword in the first place with this i still remember my grueling yet satisying first hunt of raging brachydios and furious rajang which took me 40 mins in both of those hunts solo i enjoyed grinding and beating monsters and really enjoyed joining sos of people its what made me play the game more even after defeating fatalis and basically getting my perfect set for my longsword with me joining sos and my drive to play the game more i tried and played all the weapons except for the gunlance in the time of writing the mobility of the insect glaive the spammy braindead big damage of zsd of the switch axe the absurd damage of spread with special scope hbg and etc using different weapons makes the game fresh and makes me approach monsters in different ways so i highly recommend other people to try different weapons the clutch claw mechanics i personally dont mind however the reliance for this especially in wallbanging and agitator being meta makes it so that either the monster is down or enraged in basically all hunts once you are familiar and have mastered the clutch claw overall i still like it and if it ever comes back i hope it is implemented better i feel satisfaction in helping other people in high rank and master rank people replying and commenting how they were stuck in this monster for some time and with my help and other people during that hunt made it possible to defeat that monster made me happy i have helped multiple people from the start of their journey to the endgame fatalis and played coop with them in grinding and progressing and it makes me happy despite basically replaying the game as i find multiplayer hunts very fun for the cons of the game the most apparent one is the lack of unique layered weapons especially in the base game though iceborne fixes that mostly with the dlc monsters having somewhat unique layered weapons though they still have those slapon weapons the mandatory waiting for cutscenes before other players can join the quest is annoying though mhrise have fixed that playing rise after world i wish that changing the color pigment of the layered armor has more customization the filters and joining of lobbies for the sieges could also be better as i sometimes play with friends when joining lobbies and it shows that we can all join one person usually cannot join as it is full despite checking the playerlist that the lobby is 1516 i am unsure how this happens overall i really like this game and made me a monster hunter fan and because of it i decided to play the older generation games in my own pace and when i have the time and motivation,True,49040,37205

76561199130744766,170419367,nearly 100 hours and ive barely scratched the surface super fun and worth every cent it can seem slow at first and the story isnt amazing especially since none of the characters really have names but the combat is phenomenal there are so many different weapon choices each with their unique complex move sets all of the monsters have their own gimmicks that you have to find your way around you can also interact with the environment to bring down your foe it is especially satisfying to drop a pile of boulders on a monsters head i would recommend this to anyone who wants a good challenge to dump a ton of time into on a side note if you are getting this game and the iceborne dlc i would recommend not using the defender weapons and armor they make the first quests too easy which can ruin the fun a little bit,True,5729,5252

76561198996304015,169945229,i love killing monsters lets get this out of the way this game is hard grindy and clearly not for everyone but if youre the kind of player who is willing to spend tons of hours in this game and get over the hard fights and grinds this game is the best thing ever the game goes like this you embark on a quest to kill a monster in one of 6 maps you have to prepare specially to deal with each monster each hunt generally takes 15 minutes and once you kill the monster you get materials and money to craft better equipment and hunt stronger monsters and its a loop of this formula however each hunt greatly varies depending on what monster youre hunting the attacks the monster uses where the monster goes what other monsters are present in the map what weapon youre using and how good you do in the hunt which keeps it entertaining your success as a hunter will depend on how much you know about the monster how good youre with your weapon how good you are at dodging and reading attacks and what you can do with your enviroment while the beggining ismeh it takes too long to get entertaining and may be very repetitive but once youre on your somewhat 20th hour you get really hooked up it has straight up the best creature design ever far beating pokemon gow or any other game out there they feel alive and really add something special to the enviroment and about that the maps are incredible while theyre kinda limited they look amazing and each one if fully unique now for the fighting system you have 14 different weapons each one with their unique playstyle and thats without talking about the different playstyles within each weapon the option are huge the moves are relatively slow but they feel real and the animations are perfect they did an amazing job balancing the weapons since you can beat most monsters consistently with each one you have bows guns swords staffs lances hammers and crazy weapons like charge blade and switch axe and each one of this have around 50 skins depending on what monster materials its made out of and most look really cool each monster is almost completely different from the other except for subspecies and have unique mechanics that require for special objects to deal with the game has at least 200 hours of gameplay to keep you entertained and way more if you want to kill every monster and as you progress the bosses start to get hard like really hard im talking about souls game dlc final boss difficulty and it will take some serious skill practice and some of the best equipment to kill the final boss remember this game isnt for anyone its only for people who like boss fights and a challenge so if you arent the kind of gamer who likes these things id save my money because youll most likely not enjoy it specially since theres no difficulty option but if you do like this things give it a try 97 10 dlc iceborne massive amount of contents without compromising their quality frequent free updates the only paid ones are the cosmetic ones and nothing essentials g rank difficulty and more monster varieties monster and hunter movements are very fluid overall still feels like monster hunter just very polished lazy weapon designs are still there even for additional monsters not all but still a good number of the new weapons are still the same boneiron base slapped on with some monster parts even when the monsters in question have unique weapon designs before looking at you brach drumsticks the weapon creationupgrade menu is still unnecessarily slow and convoluted prefer back then preworld its far more simple and still gets the job done also i hate how they hide the stats of your next upgrades before you get the key material which they also hide notes not a fan of the clutch claw and damage numbers but eh you can just not use those so i dont really care besides more options are always better an option where you can choose whether you want to display the weapons true or bloated raw and elements would be greatly appreciated 910,True,6647,4576

76561198101543226,169727752,ive given this game like five separate chances over the years and every time im reminded why i fucking hate it do you enjoy games where you arent actually allowed to play it do you like hobbling around with clunky controls that are unresponsive enough to make geriatrics feel like athletes in their prime do you like spending ten minutes in combat only to get third partied by a dipshit that drops bombs on you like youre a malaysian child do you like the idea of trying to get an opening on your opponent for ten minutes straight and when you finally get yourself in the perfect position to absolutely ruin it it brushes against you or screeches which knocks you out of a combo and wastes the last 10 minutes of your life just so you can do it all again do you like going on a mission realising you dont have the consumables necessary to not just die after five minutes so instead you have to go on a consumable collecting sidequest that takes twice as long as actually fighting the monster and then having to do that every fucking time you wanna fight another monster because the last one needed you to use all of your resources just to kill it not only do i not recommend this game i dont recommend rise either and im making a guess that wilds isnt gonna be much better this franchise is about as old as me and this is the gameplay formula that everyone raves about it took them fourteen years and ten releases to arrive at this this game is the peak of type 3 fun not fun in the slightest neither in the moment nor in retrospect i havent had any paid games removed from my account ever until now and if you do actually enjoy this type of game i wanna put you under a microscope and dissect you,False,2725,2725
76561198027116491,169725198,the big late game monsters are cool in theory but in practice you spend most of the fight with a close up view of the the monsters thigh while the game tries and fails to find a good view angle to let you see what the fuck the monster is doing and where you are at stuck somewhere between his toes the entire fucking fight good game but the late game is just pain at least for gunlance also they removed being able to blast wyverns out of the sky with the damned thing and thats the entire reason i picked gunlance in the first place think ill just play lance or bowgun in the next game gunlance is immobile and slow so when you have a big elder dragon doing attack that take it halfway into the next zipcode you have two options sheath and risk loosing half your health bar to an attack you are not use to using dodgerolls to avoid because you play gunlance that doesnt use them and just blocks instead or slowly waddle over at which point the monster will attack something and end up half the zone away from you again and thats assuming it isnt going to just one hit ko you with some beam regardless of your block,True,12712,12291
